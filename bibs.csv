Alterations in the habitats produced by human activity result in global warming, climatic changes, which together with globalization, increased trade, the shortening of distances thanks to transport, the increase in population and the socioeconomic activities of human cause imbalances. In many cases the vectors and hosts have adapted to the changes and have risen to higher latitudes and altitudes, which could contribute to the appearance of outbreaks or new outbreaks of new arboviruses of public health importance. Different cohabiting species can be reservoirs or vectors of arboviruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Currently, some viruses transmitted by mosquito vectors, such as dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus, have caused epidemic outbreaks with important effects on human populations. It is possible that the expansion of vectors and their diseases reaches developed countries such as the United States and the European Union with a great impact on public health. The clinical signs of the diseases produced by arboviruses can vary from nonspecific febrile syndrome, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and even death. Vectors and reservoirs in some cases are insects, such as mosquitoes and ticks; wild birds are reservoirs for the West Nile virus, small wild mammals such as rodents, bats, and domestic animals involved in food production can potentially harbor arboviruses, and the ecoepidemiological role of these is unknown.",2020-12-31,"Guzmán,Camilo;Calderón,Alfonso;Mattar,Salim;Tadeu-Figuereido,Luiz;Salazar-Bravo,Jorge;Alvis-Guzmán,Nelson;Martinez,EliasZakzuk;González,Marco",EmergingandReemergingViralPathogens,204646776,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128194003000065;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128194003000065,0pq59s73,

These newer genetically active agents have a major impact on the public health systems worldwide. Most emerging infections appear to be caused by pathogens already present in the environment, brought out of obscurity or given a selective advantage by changing conditions and afforded an opportunity to infect new host populations. Also on rare occasions, a new variant may evolve and cause a new disease. Altered virus transmission because of deforestation and environment change, ecological changes and agricultural development, commerce, technology, microbial adaptation and change, breakdown of public health measures, and deficiencies in public health infrastructure are the reasons for emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in general and viral infections in particular. Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases. Moreover, these factors are increasing in prevalence. This increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasize the urgent need for effective surveillance and control. These viruses are rich source of emerging diseases due to the introduction of infections from other species in the zoonotic pool. In the near future, there is an urgent need to monitor collaboration between human–animal interface so that public health risks can be understood. A number of activities increase microbial traffic from animals to humans or disseminate microbes from isolated groups into new populations and as a result promote emergence and epidemics. In some cases, including many of the most novel infections, the agents are zoonotic crossing from their natural hosts into the human population because of many similarities.

While many viruses are studied to seek solutions for their adverse impact on human, veterinary, and plant health, the study of baculoviruses was stimulated initially by their potential utility to control insect pests. Later, the utility of baculovirus as gene expression vectors was evidenced leading to numerous applications. Several strategies are employed to obtain recombinant viruses that express large quantities of heterologous proteins. A major step forward was the development of bacmid technology (the construction of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing the genome of the baculovirus) which allows the manipulation of the baculovirus genome in bacteria. With this technology, foreign genes can be introduced into the bacmid by homologous and site-directed recombination or by transposition. Baculoviruses have been used to explore fundamental questions in molecular biology such as the nature of programmed cell-death. Moreover, the ability of baculoviruses to transduce mammalian cells led to the consideration of their use as gene-therapy and vaccine vectors. Strategies for genetic engineering of baculoviruses have been developed to meet the requirements of new application areas. Display of foreign proteins on the surface of virions or in nucleocapsid structures, the assembly of expressed proteins to form virus-like particles or protein complexes have been explored and validated as vaccines. The aim of this chapter is to update the areas of application of the baculoviruses in protein expression, alternative vaccine designs and gene therapy of infectious diseases and genetic disorders.

However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by some RT-PCR methods, probably due to low viral load, timing of sampling, degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or possible mutations spanning the primer binding sites. Therefore, alternative and highly sensitive methods are imperative. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodating various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 343 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrated its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allowed for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. We further amplified the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome from 8 to half a million viral copies purified from 13 COVID-19 positive specimens, and detected mutations through next generation sequencing.

This is to find a short section or sections of viral protein sequence suitable for preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. The project was originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. The work can, nonetheless, be described in traditional bioinformatics terms, and readily reproduced by others, albeit with the caveat that new data and research into 2019-nCoV is emerging and evolving at an explosive pace.

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged ≥30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. Findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged ≤70 years with ≥1 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of ≥2 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age>70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with ≥3 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 80% in the UK population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. Interpretation: We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (do nothing) scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.",2020-03-24,"Banerjee,Amitava;Pasea,Laura;Harris,Steve;Gonzalez-Izquierdo,Arturo;Torralbo,Ana;Shallcross,Laura;Noursadeghi,Mahdad;Pillay,Deenan;Pagel,Christina;Wong,WaiKeong;Langenberg,Claudia;Williams,Bryan;Denaxas,Spiros;Hemingway,Harry",,216357116,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040287,11hi1jel,

Altogether, 43% (26/60) of the dogs and 79% (53/67) of the cats were positive by serology or PCR for L. infantum. The average Leishmania parasite load in the blood of PCR-positive dogs (42,967 parasites/ml) was significantly higher than in PCR-positive cats (1259 parasites/ml) (t((12)) = 2.33, P = 0.037). Dogs that were positive by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and kDNA PCR had significantly higher parasite loads than dogs positive only by the kDNA PCR (t((11)) = − 3.186580, P < 0.009). No significant effect was found for FIV seropositivity on Leishmania infection in the cats (χ(2) = 0.506, P = 0.777). A higher percentage of Leishmania-positive dogs showed clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis compared to Leishmania-positive cats (100 vs 52.8%, χ(2) =15.242, P < 0.0001). Phlebotomus perfiliewi, a proven vector of L. infantum, comprised 92% of trapped sand flies. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons of populations of cats and dogs exposed to sand flies and L. infantum under the same conditions indicated that although a high rate of exposure was detected in cats as manifested by a significantly greater degree of seropositivity, dogs had significantly higher blood parasite loads, and were likely to be more infectious to sand flies than cats.

Hence, there is an urgency to understand the response mechanisms of marine organisms to adverse environment. Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many biological processes, their roles in stress responses still remain unclear. Here, differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified as responses to environmental stresses in the economically important sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, and their potential roles were explored. Based on a total of 159, 355 and 495 significantly upregulated genes and 230, 518 and 647 significantly downregulated genes identified in the thermal, hypoxic and combination thermal + hypoxic stress treatments, respectively, we constructed DE-lncRNA-mRNA coexpression networks. Among the networks, eight shared pairs were identified from the three treatments, and based on the connectivity degree, MSTRG.27265, MSTRG.19729 and MSTRG.95524 were shown to be crucial lncRNAs. Among all the significantly changed lncRNAs identified by RT-qPCR and sequencing data, binding sites were found in four other lncRNAs (MSTRG.34610, MSTRG.10941, MSTRG.81281 and MSTRG.93731) with Aja-miR-2013-3p, a key miRNA that responds to hypoxia in sea cucumbers. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) was also shown as the possible targeted mRNA of Aja-miR-2013-3p. As indicated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay system, “HIF-1α gene/Aja-miR-2013-3p/MSTRG.34610” network and the “HIF-1α gene/Aja-miR-2013-3p/MSTRG.10941” network may play important roles in sea cucumbers under environmental stresses. Moreover, environmental stress altered the expression of multiple lncRNAs and mRNAs, thus affecting various biological processes in A. japonicus, including immunity, energy metabolism and the cell cycle. At the molecular level, more comprehensive responses were elicited by the combined thermal/hypoxic stress treatment than by individual stresses alone in sea cucumbers. This study lays the groundwork for future research on molecular mechanisms of echinoderm responses to thermal and hypoxic stress in the context of global climate changes.",2020-03-20,"Huo,Da;Sun,Lina;Storey,KennethB.;Zhang,Libin;Liu,Shilin;Sun,Jingchun;Yang,Hongsheng",SciTotalEnviron,210042296,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719360413;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31905562/;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136045;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969719360413,1roubx7a,

Methods We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Umifenovir (Arbidol) (200mg*3/day) or Favipiravir (1600mg*2/first day followed by 600mg*2/day) for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough, the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive Favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). Clinical recovery rate of Day 7 does not significantly differ between Favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (P=0.1396, difference of recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305 to 0.2213). Favipiravir led to shorter latencies to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, P<0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, P<0.0001). No difference was observed of AOT or NMV rate (both P>0.05). The most frequently observed Favipiravir-associated adverse event was raised serum uric acid (16/116, OR: 5.52, P=0.0014). Conclusions Among patients with COVID-19, Favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the clinically recovery rate at Day 7. Favipiravir significantly improved the latency to relief for pyrexia and cough. Adverse effects caused Favipiravir are mild and manageable.

Despite an abundance of small-scale observational studies, the role of the poultry trade in disseminating AIV over large geographic areas is still unclear, especially for developing countries with complex poultry production systems. Here we combine virus genomes and reconstructed poultry transportation data to measure and compare the spatial spread in China of three key subtypes of AIV: H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6. Although it is difficult to disentangle the contribution of confounding factors, such as bird migration and spatial distance, we find evidence that the dissemination of these subtypes among domestic poultry is geographically continuous and likely associated with the intensity of the live poultry trade in China. Using two independent data sources and network analysis methods, we report a regional-scale community structure in China that might explain the spread of AIV subtypes in the country.

METHODS: We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3–6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community.

Methods: The clinical data of 33 patients with respiratory symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus in Wenzhou city from January 15 to February 12,2020,were thoroughly reviewed. At the onset of the disease,we found that the primary symptoms were fever,cough,fatigue,chest tightness,chest pain and specific blood test results. According to the patients'histories,the patients were divided into two groups: those who spent time in the main epidemic area and those who did not spend time in the main epidemic area. The differences in the clinical manifestations between these two groups were analyzed. Results: The main clinical symptoms of patients infected with novel coronavirus in the secondary epidemic area were respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms. After grouping patients based on the presence or absence of residency in or travel history to the main epidemic area, there was no significant difference between the baseline data of these two groups, and there were no significant differences in symptoms and signs between the two groups (P>0.05).

We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1,24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%,1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 or 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%,1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk.",2020-03-13,"Verity,Robert;Okell,LucyC;Dorigatti,Ilaria;Winskill,Peter;Whittaker,Charles;Imai,Natsuko;Cuomo-Dannenburg,Gina;Thompson,Hayley;Walker,Patrick;Fu,Han;Dighe,Amy;Griffin,Jamie;Cori,Anne;Baguelin,Marc;Bhatia,Sangeeta;Boonyasiri,Adhiratha;Cucunuba,ZulmaM;Fitzjohn,Rich;Gaythorpe,KatyAM;Green,Will;Hamlet,Arran;Hinsley,Wes;Laydon,Daniel;Nedjati-Gilani,Gemma;Riley,Steven;van-Elsand,Sabine;Volz,Erik;Wang,Haowei;Wang,Yuanrong;Xi,Xiayoue;Donnelly,Christl;Ghani,Azra;Ferguson,Neil",,216402015,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033357,10n2u1b1,

We aimed to evaluate the definite efficacy and safety of corticosteroid in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Forty-six hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received corticosteroid treatment. The clinical symptoms and chest computed tomography(CT) results were compared. Results: A total of 26 patients received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone with a dosage of 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, while the remaining patients not. There was no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups on admission. The average number of days for body temperature back to the normal range was significantly shorter in patients with administration of methylprednisolone when compared to those without administration of methylprednisolone (2.06 ± 0.28 vs. 5.29 ± 0.70, P=0.010). The patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P<0.001). In terms of chest CT, the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in patients with administration of methylprednisolone.

Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model. Predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results. Recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS The first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in Wuhan on December 8, 2019. When Wuhan City took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; If wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on January 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on January 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. CONCLUSIONS Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role.

There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao.

The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China.

Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin.

Nearly all current drugs suffer from one or more limitations, which emphasizes the critical need to develop new approaches and new molecules. We reasoned that a ‘poly-pharmacy’ approach relying on simultaneous binding to multiple receptors involved in HCMV entry into host cells could pave the way to a more effective therapeutic outcome. This work presents the study of a synthetic, small molecule displaying pleiotropicity of interactions as a competitive antagonist of viral or cell surface receptors including heparan sulfate proteoglycans and heparan sulfate-binding proteins, which play important roles in HCMV entry and spread. Sulfated pentagalloylglucoside (SPGG), a functional mimetic of heparan sulfate, inhibits HCMV entry into human foreskin fibroblasts and neuroepithelioma cells with high potency. At the same time, SPGG exhibits no toxicity at levels as high as 50-fold more than its inhibition potency. Interestingly, cell-ELISA assays showed downregulation in HCMV immediate-early gene 1 and 2 (IE 1&2) expression in presence of SPGG further supporting inhibition of viral entry. Finally, HCMV foci were observed to decrease significantly in the presence of SPGG suggesting impact on viral spread too.

We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(≥8805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P<0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. Interpretation Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.",2020-02-29,"Xu,Hui;Huang,Sufang;Liu,Shangkun;Deng,Juan;Jiao,Bo;Ai,Ling;Xiao,Yaru;Yan,Li;Li,Shusheng",,215718843,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028084,011k6mm0,

Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronavirus spikes. The results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses.

Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical diagnosis. However, the positive rate is only 30-50%. Currently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR technology is mainly used to detect 2019-nCoV. According to “The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)” issued by National Health and Commission of China and “The Experts’ Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV” released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56°C or higher to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of 56 °C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 °C for 5 minutes when the samples were preserved by Hank’s solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 °C or higher if the samples were preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted.

Live attenuated measles vaccine strains have been used successfully for immunization for decades and are currently investigated in trials of oncolytic virotherapy. The available reverse genetics systems allow for insertion of additional genes, including heterologous antigens. Here, we designed recombinant measles vaccine vectors for priming and activation of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. For proof-of-concept, we used cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines specific for the melanoma-associated differentiation antigen tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2), or the model antigen chicken ovalbumin (OVA), respectively. We generated recombinant measles vaccine vectors with TRP-2 and OVA epitope cassette variants for expression of the full-length antigen or the respective immunodominant CD8(+) epitope, with additional variants mediating secretion or proteasomal degradation of the epitope. We show that these recombinant measles virus vectors mediate varying levels of MHC class I (MHC-I)-restricted epitope presentation, leading to activation of cognate CTLs, as indicated by secretion of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) in vitro. Importantly, the recombinant OVA vaccines also mediate priming of naïve OT-I CD8(+) T cells by dendritic cells. While all vaccine variants can prime and activate cognate T cells, IFNγ release was enhanced using a secreted epitope variant and a variant with epitope strings targeted to the proteasome.

The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

Typically, symptoms of scabies are characterized by an erythematous, papular, pruritic rash associated with burrows. Treatment of scabies involves using topical or systemic scabicides and treating secondary bacterial infections, if present. Given the prevalence and contagiousness of scabies, measures to prevent its spread are essential. Through application of the novel Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, emergency medical providers can readily identify risk factors for exposure and important symptoms of the disease, thus limiting its spread through prompt scabicide therapy; isolate the patient until after treatment; and inform local public health authorities and hospital infection prevention, when appropriate.

Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score ≥10 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p<0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4), followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3).

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409–7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128–1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588–13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th – 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.",2020-02-14,"Roosa,K.;Lee,Y.;Luo,R.;Kirpich,A.;Rothenberg,R.;Hyman,J.M.;Yan,P.;Chowell,G.",InfectDisModel,211082793,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32110742/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300051;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300051;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.002,0zw3ukpx,

SFTSV was first isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction in China. Subsequently, it was found to be widely distributed in Southeast Asia (Korea, Japan, and Vietnam). SFTSV can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals, companion animals, and humans. Because the case fatality rate of SFTS is high (6–30%), development of specific and effective treatment for SFTS is required. Studies of potential antiviral drugs for SFTS-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo, with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates. While animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin, it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load <1 × 10(6) copies/mL. Favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against SFTSV in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models, even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation. Although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in SFTS patients in Japan are underway, this has yet to be confirmed. Other drugs, including hexachlorophene, calcium channel blockers, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine, caffeic acid, amodiaquine, and interferons, have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against SFTSV. Among them, calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo, retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine, one of the calcium channel blockers, reduced the case fatality rate by >5-fold. Although further research is necessary to develop SFTS-specific therapy, considerable progress has been achieved in this area.

CoV infection requires spike proteins, which bind viruses to host cell receptors and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. Several CoV strains have spike proteins with two receptor-binding domains, an S1A that engages host sialic acids and an S1B that recognizes host transmembrane proteins. As this bivalent binding may enable broad zoonotic CoV infection, we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages. Focusing on two betacoronaviruses, murine JHM-CoV and human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by sialic acids; however, the transmembrane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection. These results favored a two-step process in which viruses first adhere to sialic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry. However, sialic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell-cell membrane fusion, without requiring protein receptors. This virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive S1A mutations.

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

TGF-β-stimulated IPEC-J2 cells highly up-regulated FcRn expression, while treatment with a JNK-specific inhibitor down-regulated the expression. TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein also enhanced FcRn promoter activity via the NF-κB signaling pathway and its central region (aa 128–252) was essential for FcRn activation.

Each attribute was evaluated using pre-defined indicators. For each indicator we obtained the proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the total. A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each attribute as follows: < 60% (as obtained in the calculation above) scored 1 (weak performance); 60–79% scored 2 (moderate performance); ≥80% scored 3 (good performance). An overall score for each attribute and the ISS was obtained by averaging the scores of all evaluated attributes. RESULTS: The overall mean score for the ISS in Zambia was 2.6. Key strengths of the system were the quality of data generated (score: 2.9), its flexibility (score: 3.0) especially to monitor viral pathogens other than influenza viruses, its simplicity (score: 2.8), acceptability (score: 3.0) and stability (score: 2.6) over the review period and its relatively low cost ($310,000 per annum). Identified weaknesses related mainly to geographic representativeness (score: 2.0), timeliness (score: 2.5), especially in shipment of samples from remote sites, and sustainability (score: 1.0) in the absence of external funds. CONCLUSIONS: The system performed moderately well in our evaluation. Key improvements would include improvements in the timeliness of samples shipments and geographical coverage. However, these improvements would result in increased cost and logistical complexity. The ISSS in Zambia is largely reliant on external funds and the acceptability of maintaining the surveillance system through national funds would require evaluation.",2020-01-13,"Simusika,Paul;Tempia,Stefano;Chentulo,Edward;Polansky,Lauren;Mazaba,MazyangaLucy;Ndumba,Idah;Mbewe,QuinnK.;Monze,Mwaka",BMCHealthServRes,210166233,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4884-5;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931793/,0pfrk5uk,

Herein, we designed the peptide constructs derived from E5 and E7 oncoproteins of high-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 45 using the bioinformatics tools and investigated their potency in mice. RESULTS: The framework of the combined in silico/in vivo analysis included (1) to determine physicochemical properties of the designed constructs, (2) to identify potential IFN-γ-inducing epitopes, (3) to assess allergenicity, (4) to recognize linear and discontinuous B cell epitopes using modeling and validation of 3D structure of the designed constructs, and (5) to evaluate immune responses and tumor growth in vivo. Our in silico data determined high potency of the HPV(16,18,31,45) E5 and HPV(16,18,31,45) E7 peptides for trigger B- and T-cell responses, and IFN-γ secretion. In vivo study indicated that the mixture of E5 and E7 immunodominant peptides from four types of high-risk HPV could induce Th1 immune response, and protect completely mice against TC-1 tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Generally, the combined in silico/in vivo approaches showed the ability of the designed E5 and E7 peptide constructs from four major high-risk HPV types for development of therapeutic vaccines.

Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity. In this study, antiviral activity examination of different resistant strains showed that the digestive juice of the resistant strain (A35) had higher inhibition to virus than the susceptible strain (P50). Subsequently, the label-free quantitative proteomics was used to study the midgut digestive juice response to BmNPV infection in P50 and A35 strains. A total of 98 proteins were identified, of which 80 were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with 54 enzymes and 26 nonenzymatic proteins by comparing the proteomes of infected and non-infected P50 and A35 silkworms. These DEPs are mainly involved in metabolism, proteolysis, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, starch and sucrose metabolism and glutathione metabolism. After removing the genetic background and individual immune stress response proteins, 9 DEPs were identified potentially involved in resistance to BmNPV. Further studies showed that a serine protease, an alkaline phosphatase and serine protease inhibitor 2 isoform X1 were differentially expressed in A35 compared to P50 or post BmNPV infection. Taken together, these results provide insights into the potential mechanisms for silkworm digestive juice to provide resistance to BmNPV infection. Signifcance: Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is highly pathogenic, which has a great impact on the sericulture. BmNPV entered the midgut lumen and exposed to digestive juices after oral infection. Previous studies have revealed that some proteins in silkworm digestive juice show antiviral activity, however, current information on the digestive juice proteome of high resistant silkworm strain after BmNPV challenge compared to susceptible strain is incomprehensive. Here, we combined label-free quantification method, bioinformatics, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis and found that BmNPV infection causes some protein changes in the silkworm midgut digestive juice. The DEPs were identified in the digestive juices of different resistant strains following BmNPV infection, and screened out some proteins potentially related to resistance to BmNPV. Three important differentially expression proteins were validated by independent approaches. These findings uncover the potential role of silkworm digestive juice in providing resistance to BmNPV and supplemented the profile of the proteome of the digestive juices in B. mori.",2020-01-06,"Zhang,Shang-zhi;Wang,Jie;Zhu,Lin-bao;Toufeeq,Shahzad;Xu,Xin;You,Ling-ling;Li,Bing;Hu,Pei;Xu,Jia-ping",JProteomics,204703059,True,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2019.103527;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391919302994;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610263/;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874391919302994,0isssmbl,

In addition to reporting five novel HMPV genomes from Africa we examined genetic diversity and sequence patterns of publicly available HMPV genomes. We found that the overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3 and 80% for HMPV group A and B, respectively, the diversity between HMPV groups was greater at amino acid level for SH and G surface protein genes, and multiple subgroups co-circulated in various countries. Comparison of sequences between HMPV groups revealed variability in G protein length (219 to 241 amino acids) due to changes in the stop codon position.

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes serious vomiting and diarrhea in suckling piglets. In this study, the role of Ca(2+) to PDCoV infection was investigated. PDCoV infection was found to upregulate intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations of IPI-2I cells. Chelating extracellular Ca(2+) by EGTA inhibited PDCoV replication, and this inhibitory effect was overcome by replenishment with CaCl(2). Treatment with Ca(2+) channel blockers, particularly the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker diltiazem hydrochloride, inhibited PDCoV infection significantly. Mechanistically, diltiazem hydrochloride reduces PDCoV infection by inhibiting the replication step of the viral replication cycle.

The secondary objectives were to determine whether ampicillin affected respiratory score, gross consolidation, or the detection of P. multocida in lung tissue at postmortem exam (PME). Holstein bull calves (n = 39) were transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine isolation facility at the mean (±SD) age of 52 ± 6 d. After a 7-d acclimation period, 30 calves were inoculated intratracheally with 1010 cfu of ampicillin-sensitive P. multocida. Lung US and respiratory scoring were performed 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-challenge, then US once daily and respiratory scoring twice daily until d 14. Calves were randomized to receive ampicillin [n = 17, treatment (TX), 6.6 mg/kg i.m. once daily for 3 d] or placebo [n = 11, control (CON), saline, equal volume, i.m. once daily for 3 d] when ≥1 cm2 of lung consolidation was observed and ≥6 h had elapsed since challenge. Lung lesions ≥1 cm2 were considered positive for consolidation. Calves were respiratory score positive if ≥2 in 2 or more categories based on the Wisconsin respiratory health score chart. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for US score and respiratory score as a proxy for time with consolidation and clinical respiratory disease, respectively. Gross lung lesions and pathogens were quantified following PME. At the time of first treatment, consolidation had developed in 28/30 calves (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11) and 6% (1 out of 17) of TX and 9% (1 out of 11) of CON calves had a positive respiratory score. The TX calves had a significantly lower median (interquartile range given in parentheses) AUC for US score [TX: 23 (20, 29), CON: 47 (33, 53)], whereas mean AUC for respiratory score was not different between groups (TX: 93 ± 28, CON: 96 ± 17). On d 14, 70% (12 out of 17) of TX and 100% (11 out of 11) of CON calves had lung consolidation, and 24% (4 out of 17) of TX and 27% (3 out of 11) of CON calves had clinical respiratory disease. On PME, median consolidation was 10% (6, 15) for TX and 10% (2, 28) for CON calves. Lung cultures were positive for P. multocida in 77% (13 out of 17) of TX and 91% (10 out of 11) of CON calves. Lung health benefited from a 3-d ampicillin therapy, but benefits were short-lived. Treatment failures might be due to incomplete resolution of the initial lung infection.

Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the top four affected phyla. The proportion of Proteobacteria was higher in infected than in healthy piglets, and the opposite was observed for Bacteroidetes (more than four-fold higher in the healthy group). In the infected group, Fusobacterium accounted for 36.56% and 21.61% in the colonic mucosa and contents, respectively, while in the healthy group, they comprised 22.53% and 12.67%, respectively. The percentage of Lactobacillus in healthy colons (15.63%) was considerably higher than that in the disease group (<10%). In both the colonic mucosa and contents, functional enrichment differed significantly between healthy and diseased groups.

Powder dissolution experiments under non-sink conditions showed similar dissolution profiles for the cocrystals and pure NTZ. However, pre-dissolved cellulosic polymer in the phosphate dissolution medium (pH 7.5) modified the dissolution profile of NTZ when starting from the cocrystals, achieving transient drug supersaturation. Subsequent dissolution studies under sink conditions of polymer-based pharmaceutical powder formulations with NTZ-SUC cocrystals gave a significant improvement of the apparent solubility of NTZ when compared with analogous formulations of pure NTZ and the physical mixture of NTZ and SUC. Scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis of samples recovered after the powder dissolution studies showed that the cocrystals undergo fast dissolution, drug supersaturation and precipitation both in the absence and presence of polymer, suggesting that the solubilization enhancement is due to polymer-induced delay of nucleation and crystal growth of the less soluble NTZ form. The study demonstrates that the incorporation of an appropriate excipient in adequate concentration can be a key factor for inducing and maintaining the solubilization of poorly soluble drugs starting from co-crystallized solid forms.

Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential for a diagnostic test for influenza virus which also provides insights on transmission, evolution, and drug resistance and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing method to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated influenza virus reads down to a limit of detection of 10(2) to 10(3) genome copies/ml in pooled samples, observing a strong relationship between the viral titer and the proportion of influenza virus reads (P = 4.7 × 10(−5)). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza virus reads for 27/27 samples with mid-to-high viral titers (cycle threshold [C(T)] values, <30) and 6/13 samples with low viral titers (C(T) values, 30 to 40). No false-positive reads were generated from 10 influenza virus-negative samples. Thus, Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 93%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 69 to 100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full-length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza virus titers, we were able to reconstruct >99% complete sequences for all eight gene segments. We also detected a human coronavirus coinfection in one clinical sample.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role within the innate immune system and TLR7 agonists have previously been shown to up-regulate Th1 responses and down-regulate Th2 responses to allergens in murine models of allergic or chronic asthma. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of the novel TRL7 agonist AZD8848, which has been developed as an antedrug. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, AZD8848 60 μg or placebo was administered intranasally once-weekly for 8 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma (NCT00999466). Efficacy assessments were performed at 1 and 4 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome was the late asthmatic response (LAR) fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) after allergen challenge at 1-week post-treatment. RESULTS: AZD8848 significantly reduced average LAR fall in FEV(1) by 27% vs. placebo at 1 week after treatment (p = 0.035). This effect was sustained at 4 weeks post-treatment; however, it did not reach clinical significance. AZD8848 reduced post-allergen challenge methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) vs. placebo at 1 week post-dosing (treatment ratio: 2.20, p = 0.024), with no effect at 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the two groups in plasma cytokine, sputum Th2 cytokine or eosinophil responses post-allergen challenge at 1 week after treatment. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. AZD8848 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with allergic asthma, TLR7 agonists could potentially reduce allergen responsiveness by stimulating Type 1 interferon responses to down-regulate the dominant Th2 responses.

SKP2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation in a hetero-complex involving FKBP51, PHLPP, AKT1, and BECN1. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) multiplication results in reduced BECN1 levels and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes.

Attempts to target the kidney Renin Angiotensin System using native ACE2 to treat kidney disease are hampered by its large molecular size, 100 kDa, which precludes its glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular uptake. Here, we show that both urine and kidney lysates are capable of digesting native ACE2 into shorter proteins of ~60–75 kDa and then demonstrate that they are enzymatically very active. We then truncated the native ACE2 by design from the C-terminus to generate two short recombinant (r)ACE2 variants (1-605 and 1-619AA). These two truncates have a molecular size of ~70 kDa, as expected from the amino acid sequence and as shown by Western blot. ACE2 enzyme activity, measured using a specific substrate, was higher than that of the native rACE2 (1-740 AA). When infused to mice with genetic ACE2 deficiency, a single i.v. injection of 1-619 resulted in detectable ACE2 activity in urine, whereas infusion of the native ACE2 did not. Moreover, ACE2 activity was recovered in harvested kidneys from ACE2-deficient mice infused with 1-619, but not in controls (23.1 ± 4.3 RFU/µg creatinine/h and 1.96 ± 0.73 RFU/µg protein/hr, respectively). In addition, the kidneys of ACE2-null mice infused with 1-619 studied ex vivo formed more Ang (1–7) from exogenous Ang II than those infused with vehicle (AUC 8555 ± 1933 vs. 3439 ± 753 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.05) further demonstrating the functional effect of increasing kidney ACE2 activity after the infusion of our short ACE2 1-619 variant. We conclude that our novel short recombinant ACE2 variants undergo glomerular filtration, which is associated with kidney uptake of enzymatically active proteins that can enhance the formation of Ang (1–7) from Ang II.

An efficient vaccine for the prophylaxis of humans in hotspots of the infection (e.g., Saudi Arabia) is necessary but no commercial vaccines are yet approved. In this study, a chimeric DNA construct was designed to encode an influenza A/H1N1 NA protein which is flanking immunogenic amino acids (aa) 736–761 of MERS-CoV spike protein. Using the generated chimeric construct, a novel recombinant vaccine strain against pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) and MERS-CoV was generated (chimeric bivalent 5 + 3). The chimeric bivalent 5 + 3 vaccine strain comprises a recombinant PR8-based vaccine, expressing the PB1, HA, and chimeric NA of pandemic 2009 H1N1. Interestingly, an increase in replication efficiency of the generated vaccine strain was observed when compared to the PR8-based 5 + 3 H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain that lacks the MERS-CoV spike peptide insert. In BALB/c mice, the inactivated chimeric bivalent vaccine induced potent and specific neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and H1N1pdm09. This novel approach succeeded in developing a recombinant influenza virus with potential use as a bivalent vaccine against H1N1pdm09 and MERS-CoV.

In group 4, lambs with cryptosporidiosis were subjected to normal feeding as control without drug administration. Clinical examinations of lambs were made before treatment (day 0) and on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after treatment and 5 ml of blood was collected from vena jugularis for blood analysis of all lambs. Weight changes of lambs were recorded at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days.

Lambs with a mean oocyte counts >10 after stool examination were included to the treatment. Changes in clinical hematology, blood gases and biochemical parameters were observed during the course of treatment, but these changes were limited. Weight loss was observed at 7th day according to 0th day the lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis but gradually weight increase was observed at 14th and 21st days and these changes were similar in all groups.

Since the outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003, the scale of PHW in China has been continuously expanding, but policymakers and researchers still focus on the distribution of public health personnel, especially the regional inequality in such distribution. We aimed to identify the root cause of PHW inequality by decomposing different geographical units in China. METHODS: This study was based on data from a nationwide survey, which included 2712 county-level data. The distribution of the PHW in geographical units was evaluated by the Gini coefficient and Theil T index, and inequalities at regional, provincial, and municipal levels were decomposed to identify the root causes of inequalities in the PHW. Additionally, the contextual factors affecting the distribution of the PHW were determined through regression analysis. RESULTS: The overall inequality results show that health professional and field epidemiological investigators faced worse inequality than the staff. In particular, field epidemiological investigators had a Gini coefficient close to 0.4. Step decomposition showed that within-region inequalities accounted for 98.5% or more of overall inter-county inequality in the distribution of all PHW categories; provincial decomposition showed that at least 74% of inequality is still distributed within provinces; the overall contribution of within-municipal inequality and between-municipal inequality was basically the same. Further, the contextual factor that influenced between-municipality and within-municipality inequality for all three categories of PHWs was the agency building area per employee. Per capita GDP had a similar effect, except for between-municipality inequality of professionals and within-municipality inequality of field epidemiological investigators. CONCLUSIONS: The successive decomposition showed that inequality is mainly concentrated in counties at the within-province and within-municipal levels. This study clearly suggests that the government, especially the municipal government at the provincial level, should increase financial investment in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) with worse resource allocation in their jurisdiction through various ways of compensation and incentives, enhance their infrastructure, and improve the salary of personnel in these institutions, to attract more public health professionals to these institutions.",2019-11-21,"Cai,Weiqin;Li,Chengyue;Sun,Mei;Hao,Mo",IntJEquityHealth,208210545,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752854/;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-019-1073-4,0yiek4bg,

These water stressors are exacerbated by climate change, as well as the growth and urbanisation of industry and commerce. Consequently, urban water authorities around the globe are exploring alternative water sources to meet ever-increasing demands. These alternative sources are primarily treated sewage, stormwater, and groundwater. Stormwater including roof-harvested rainwater has been considered as an alternative water source for both potable and non-potable uses. One of the most significant issues concerning alternative water reuse is the public health risk associated with chemical and microbial contaminants. Several studies to date have quantified fecal indicators and pathogens in stormwater. Microbial source tracking (MST) approaches have also been used to determine the sources of fecal contamination in stormwater and receiving waters.

All published items concern articles, books, reviews, reports, conference announcements, and dissertations. We used a variation of PRISMA Statements methodology to conduct a systematic review. The review identifies the relevant published papers from the year 2004 to 2018, systematically includes and explores them to extract similarities, gaps, and conclusions on the research that has been done so far. The results presented concern the year, the examined disease, the web data source, the geographic location/country, and the data analysis method used. The results show that influenza is the most examined infectious disease. The internet tools most used are Twitter and Google. Regarding the geographical areas explored in the published papers, the most examined country is the United States, since many scientists come from this country. There is a significant growth of articles since 2009. There are also various statistical methods used to correlate the data retrieved from the internet to the data from national authorities. The conclusion of all researches is that the Web can be a useful tool for the detection of serious epidemics and for a creation of a syndromic surveillance system using the Web, since we can predict epidemics from web data before they are officially detected in population. With the advance of ICT, Smart Healthcare can benefit from the monitoring of epidemics and the early prediction of such a system, improving national or international health strategies and policy decision. This can be achieved through the provision of new technology tools to enhance health monitoring systems toward the new innovations of Smart Health or eHealth, even with the emerging technologies of Internet of Things. The challenges and impacts of an electronic system based on internet data include the social, medical, and technological disciplines.

However, the relationship between ER stress, autophagy, and viral replication during in vivo and in vitro infection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) remains unclear. In this study, we established a pig model for CSFV infection and found that viral loads of CSFV differed in 10 kinds of infected organs, and that the degree of tissue lesions was to some extent positively correlated with CSFV replication in vivo. Next, we found that CSFV infection not only induced ER stress and subsequently activated three unfolded protein responses (UPR) pathways including protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6) pathways, but also triggered complete autophagy in main immune organs and partial nonimmune organs exhibiting severer pathological injuries and higher viral loads. However, only the IRE1 pathway and no autophagy were activated in some other nonimmune organs with slighter pathologies and lower viral loads. These results indicate a potential link between CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy, both of which are associated with the CSFV replication in vivo. We further performed in vitro experiments and found that CSFV infection activates the PERK and IRE1 pathways and autophagy in cultured porcine kidney cell lines (PK-15) and macrophage cell lines (3D4/2), and pharmacological regulation of ER stress remarkably changed autophagic activities induced by CSFV, suggesting that CSFV-induced autophagy can be mediated by ER stress possibly via the PERK and IRE1 pathway. Furthermore, treatment with ER stress regulators significantly altered copy numbers of NS5B genes, expression of Npro proteins, and viral titers in CSFV-infected cells or in cells treated with autophagy regulators prior to CSFV infection, suggesting the requirement of ER stress-mediated autophagy for CSFV replication in vitro. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CSFV induces ER stress-mediated autophagy to sustain its replication in vivo and in vitro, which may be one of the potential strategies exploited by CSFV for immune evasion. This finding will provide new insights into mechanisms of replication and pathogenesis of CSFV, and development of new strategies for controlling CSF.",2019-11-12,"Zhu,Erpeng;Chen,Wenxian;Qin,Yuwei;Ma,Shengming;Fan,Shuangqi;Wu,Keke;Li,Wenhui;Fan,Jindai;Yi,Lin;Ding,Hongxing;Chen,Jinding;Zhao,Mingqiu",FrontMicrobiol,207958280,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02545;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798542/,29ggtudj,

International migration to Japan, a country with dominant ethnic homogeneity, is growing steadily amid an ageing domestic population and severe labour shortages. OBJECTIVES: To identify the contemporary barriers to, and facilitators of, mental well-being among the migrant population in Japan. DESIGN: Systematic review DATA SOURCES: PubMed, ProQuest, Web of Science, Ichushi and J-Stage ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Research articles examining the mental well-being of international migrants in Japan that were published in English or Japanese between January 2000 and September 2018 were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Full texts of relevant articles were screened and references of the included studies were hand-searched for further admissible articles. Study characteristics, mental well-being facilitators and barriers, as well as policy recommendations were synthesised into categorical observations and were then thematically analysed. RESULTS: Fifty-five studies (23 published in English), surveying a total of 8649 migrants, were identified. The most commonly studied migrant nationalities were Brazilian (36%), followed by Chinese (27%) and Filipino (8%). Thematic analysis of barriers to mental well-being among migrants chiefly identified ‘language difficulties’, ‘being female’ and ‘lack of social support’, whereas the primary facilitators were ‘social networks’ followed by ‘cultural identity’. Policy recommendations for authorities generally described more migrant support services and cross-cultural awareness among the Japanese public. CONCLUSION: Access to social support networks of various types appears to be an influential factor affecting the mental well-being of international migrants in Japan. More research is necessary on how to promote such connections to foster a more inclusive and multicultural Japanese society amid rapid demographic change.

RHD, characterized by hemorrhaging, liver necrosis, and high morbidity and mortality in rabbits and hares, causes severe economic losses in the rabbit industry worldwide. Due to the lack of an efficient in-vitro propagation system for RHDV, the current vaccine is produced via chemical inactivation of crude RHDV preparation derived from the livers of infected rabbits. Inactivated vaccines are effective for controlling RHD, but the potential problems of biosafety and animal welfare have negative effects on the application of inactivated vaccines. In this study, an oral Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) vaccine was used as an antigen delivery system to express RHDV capsid protein VP60(VP1)-eGFP fusion protein. The expression of the recombinant protein was confirmed via western blotting and immunofluorescence (IFA). Our results indicate that oral administration of this probiotic vaccine can stimulate secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and IgG-based humoral immune responses in rabbits.

However, using conventional diagnostic techniques, a causative agent is not always found. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) allows analysis of the complete virome, but has not yet been applied in COPD exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: To study the respiratory virome in nasopharyngeal samples during COPD exacerbations using mNGS. STUDY DESIGN: 88 nasopharyngeal swabs from 63 patients from the Bergen COPD Exacerbation Study (2006–2010) were analysed by mNGS and in-house qPCR for respiratory viruses. Both DNA and RNA were sequenced simultaneously using an Illumina library preparation protocol with in-house adaptations. RESULTS: By mNGS, 24/88 samples tested positive. Sensitivity and specificity, as compared with PCR, were 96% and 98% for diagnostic targets (23/24 and 1093/1120, respectively). Additional viral pathogens detected by mNGS were herpes simplex virus type 1 and coronavirus OC43. A positive correlation was found between Cq value and mNGS viral normalized species reads (log value) (p = 0.002). Patients with viral pathogens had lower percentages of bacteriophages (p<0.001). No correlation was found between viral reads and clinical markers. CONCLUSIONS: The mNGS protocol used was highly sensitive and specific for semi-quantitative detection of respiratory viruses. Excellent negative predictive value implicates the power of mNGS to exclude any pathogenic respiratory viral infectious cause in one test, with consequences for clinical decision making. Reduced abundance of bacteriophages in COPD patients with viral pathogens implicates skewing of the virome during infection, with potential consequences for the bacterial populations, during infection.",2019-10-24,"vanRijn,AnneloesL.;vanBoheemen,Sander;Sidorov,Igor;Carbo,EllenC.;Pappas,Nikos;Mei,Hailiang;Feltkamp,Mariet;Aanerud,Marianne;Bakke,Per;Claas,EricC.J.;Eagan,TomasM.;Hiemstra,PieterS.;Kroes,AloysC.M.;deVries,JutteJ.C.",PLoSOne,204884303,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647831/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223952,0rupk21u,

Fragile health systems can become overwhelmed during public health crises, further exacerbating the human, economic, and political toll. Important work has been done to describe the general attributes of a health system resilient to these crises, and the next step will be to identify the specific capacities that health systems need to develop and maintain to achieve resiliency. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature to identify recurring themes and capacities needed for health system resiliency to infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards and any existing implementation frameworks that highlight these capacities. We also sought to identify the overlap of the identified themes and capacities with those highlighted in the World Health Organization’s Joint External Evaluation. Sources of evidence included PubMed, Web of Science, OAIster, and the websites of relevant major public health organizations. RESULTS: We identified 16 themes of health system resilience, including: the need to develop plans for altered standards of care during emergencies, the need to develop plans for post-event recovery, and a commitment to quality improvement. Most of the literature described the general attributes of a resilient health system; no implementation frameworks were identified that could translate these elements into specific capacities that health system actors can employ to improve resilience to outbreaks and natural hazards in a variety of settings. CONCLUSIONS: An implementation-oriented health system resilience framework could help translate the important components of a health system identified in this review into specific capacities that actors in the health system could work to develop to improve resilience to public health crises.

However, effective prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines have yet to be developed for completely curing deadly diseases, such as cancer, malaria, HIV, and serious microbial infections.

Nanotechnology has been found to play a unique role in the design of vaccines, providing them with enhanced specificity and potency. Nano-scaled materials, such as virus-like particles, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), and protein NPs, have received considerable attention over the past decade as potential carriers for the delivery of vaccine antigens and adjuvants, due to their beneficial advantages, like improved antigen stability, targeted delivery, and long-time release, for which antigens/adjuvants are either encapsulated within, or decorated on, the NP surface.

PROBLEM: Despite education about infection prevention practices, frequent RV outbreaks were declared each year at our rehabilitation facility. METHODS: Before and after study design. The primary outcome was the number of bed closure days due to outbreak per overall bed days. Process measures included delays in initiation of transmission-based precautions, RV testing and reporting of staff to occupational health and safety (OHS). Balancing measures included the number of isolation days and staff missed work hours.

However the animal-to-human spillover events that lead to emerging diseases are rarely observed or clinically examined, and the link between specific interactions and spillover risk is poorly understood. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted biological-behavioral surveillance among rural residents in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong districts of Southern China, where we have identified a number of SARS-related coronaviruses in bats. Serum samples were tested for four bat-borne coronaviruses using newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Survey data were used to characterize associations between human-animal contact and bat coronavirus spillover risk. A total of 1,596 residents were enrolled in the study from 2015 to 2017. Nine participants (0.6%) tested positive for bat coronaviruses. 265 (17%) participants reported severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and/or influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms in the past year, which were associated with poultry, carnivore, rodent/shrew, or bat contact, with variability by family income and district of residence. This study provides serological evidence of bat coronavirus spillover in rural communities in Southern China. The low seroprevalence observed in this study suggests that bat coronavirus spillover is a rare event. Nonetheless, this study highlights associations between human-animal interaction and zoonotic spillover risk.

The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics and outcomes of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses. METHODS: Clinical data of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with respiratory viruses January 2014–June 2018 were reviewed. Respiratory viral infection was identified by multiplex reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among 126 patients who underwent multiplex RT-PCR, respiratory viral infection was identified in 46% (58/126): 28 patients with influenza and 30 patients with other respiratory viruses. There was no significant difference in baseline and clinical characteristics between patients with influenza and those with other respiratory viruses. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was more frequent in patients with influenza than in those with other respiratory viruses (32.1% vs 3.3%, p=0.006). Co-bacterial pathogens were more frequently isolated from respiratory samples of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza virus than those with other respiratory viruses.

However, limited data are available for calf morbidity and mortality risks on Australian dairy farms. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate current calf management practices on dairy farms in Australia and their association with herd-level morbidity and mortality using a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study; and (2) to estimate the prevalence of common enteropathogens causing diarrhea, the failure of passive transfer of immunity, and poor colostrum quality in a sample of Australian dairy farms. We analyzed 106 completed questionnaires and samples from 23 farms (202 fecal, 253 calf serum, and 221 colostrum samples). Morbidity and mortality risks reported by farmers in preweaned heifers were 23.8 and 5.6%, respectively. These risks were above the Australian dairy industry targets in 75.5 and 66.7% of respondents. The zoonotic pathogens Cryptosporidium spp. and Salmonella spp. were the most prevalent enteropathogens, with a true prevalence of 40.9 and 25.2%, respectively. Salmonella O-group D was present in 67.9% of Salmonella-positive samples, followed by O-groups B (17.9%) and C (10.7%). Failure of transfer of passive immunity (IgG <10 g/L) was observed in 41.9% of calves (mean herd-level prevalence of 36.2%), and only 19.5% of colostrum samples met the standards for immunoglobulin content and microbiological quality.

The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; encoded by ABCG2) regulates the fusion of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts and protects the fetus from maternally derived xenobiotics. Information about BCRP function in EVTs is limited, however placental exposure to bacterial/viral infection leads to BCRP downregulation in syncitiotrophoblasts. We hypothesized that BCRP is involved in the regulation of EVT function and is modulated by infection/inflammation. We report that besides syncitiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts, BCRP is also expressed in EVTs. BCRP inhibits EVT cell migration in HTR8/SVneo (human EVT-like) cells and in human EVT explant cultures, while not affecting cell proliferation. We have also shown that bacterial—lipopolysaccharide (LPS)—and viral antigens—single stranded RNA (ssRNA)—have a profound effect in downregulating ABCG2 and BCRP levels, whilst simultaneously increasing the migration potential of EVT-like cells. Our study reports a novel function of BCRP in early placentation and suggests that exposure of EVTs to maternal infection/inflammation could disrupt their migration potential via the downregulation of BCRP.

Rapid detection of these viruses is crucial to inform implementation of appropriate control measures. The objective of our study is developing a simple, rapid and field applicable recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)–nucleic acid lateral flow (NALF) immunoassay for detection of NDV and IBV. Isothermal amplification of the matrix protein (M) gene of NDV and the nucleoprotein (N) gene of IBV was implemented via recombinase polymerase amplification at 38 °C for 40 min and 20 min, respectively using modified labeled primers.

The results revealed that RPA-NALF immunoassays can detect both viruses after 40 min at 38 °C and only NDV after 20 min. The limit of detection (LOD) was 10 genomic copies/RPA reaction. The assays results on clinical samples collected from diseased chicken farms demonstrated a good performance in comparison with quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

Taeniidae (Taenia/Echinococcus), Sarcocystis spp. and Toxascaris leonina were most common in faecal samples from YNP, whereas Capillaria spp., Taeniidae and Uncinaria stenocephala were predominant in PNALM. We used generalised linear mixed models to assess the relationship between parasite infection or the number of parasite taxa and selected ecological drivers across study areas. Significant effects illustrated the importance of the ecological factors such as occurrence of free-ranging dogs, diet composition and wolf density, as well as the ancestry of the wolf populations, in shaping parasite-wolf communities.

Mechanisms between HAP and pneumonia are poorly understood, but studies suggest that HAP may increase the likelihood of bacterial, instead of viral, pneumonia. We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS). METHODS: Data are from GRAPHS, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions (improved biomass or LPG) versus the 3-stone (baseline) cookstove. Infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 130) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by MassTag polymerase chain reaction. Data analyses included intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm, and exposure-response relationships. RESULTS: In ITT analyses, 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the LPG (LPG: 2.71, 3-stone: 3.34, p < 0.0001, n = 260). This difference was driven by increased bacterial (p < 0.0001) rather than viral species presence (non-significant). Results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls. Higher prevalence bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exposure-response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured CO and nasal microbial carriage. CONCLUSIONS: Our intention-to-treat findings are consistent with a link between HAP and bacterial nasal carriage. No relationships were found for viral carriage.

In China, eight IIDs are listed as notifiable infectious diseases, including cholera, poliomyelitis, dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid (TAP), viral Hepatitis A, viral Hepatitis E, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and other infectious diarrhoeal diseases (OIDDs). The aim of the study is to analyse the spatio-temporal distribution of IIDs from 2006 to 2016. METHODS: Data on the incidence of IIDs from 2006 to 2016 were collected from the public health science data centre issued by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This study applied seasonal decomposition analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis and space-time scan analysis. Plots and maps were constructed to visualize the spatio-temporal distribution of IIDs. RESULTS: Regarding temporal analysis, the incidence of HFMD and Hepatitis E showed a distinct increasing trend, while the incidence of TAP, dysentery, and Hepatitis A presented decreasing trends over the last decade. The incidence of OIID remained steady. Summer is the season with the greatest number of cases of different IIDs. Regarding the spatial distribution, approximately all p values for the global Moran’s I from 2006 to 2016 were less than 0.05, indicating that the incidences of the epidemics were unevenly distributed throughout the country. The high-risk areas for HFMD and OIDD were located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan (BTT) region and south China. The high-risk areas for TAP were located in some parts of southwest China. A higher incidence rates for dysentery and Hepatitis A were observed in the BTT region and some west provincial units. The high-risk areas for Hepatitis E were the BTT region and the Yangtze River Delta area. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our temporal and spatial analysis of IIDs, we identified the high-risk periods and clusters of regions for the diseases. HFMD and OIDD exhibited high incidence rates, which reflected the negligence of Class C diseases by the government. At the same time, the incidence rate of Hepatitis E gradually surpassed Hepatitis A. The authorities should pay more attention to Class C diseases and Hepatitis E. Regardless of the various distribution patterns of IIDs, disease-specific, location-specific, and disease-combined interventions should be established.

Each viral RdRP contains a 500–600 residue catalytic module with palm, fingers, and thumb domains forming an encircled human right hand architecture. Seven polymerase catalytic motifs are located in the RdRP palm and fingers domains, comprising the most conserved parts of the RdRP and are responsible for the RNA-only specificity in catalysis. Functional regions are often found fused to the RdRP catalytic module, resulting in a high level of diversity in RdRP global structure and regulatory mechanism. In this review, we surveyed all 46 RdRP-sequence available virus families of the positive-strand RNA viruses listed in the 2018b collection of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) and chose a total of 49 RdRPs as representatives. By locating hallmark residues in RdRP catalytic motifs and by referencing structural and functional information in the literature, we were able to estimate the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the catalytic module in these RdRPs, which in turn serve as reference points to predict additional functional regions beyond the catalytic module. Interestingly, a large number of virus families may have additional regions fused to the RdRP N-terminus, while only a few of them have such regions on the C-terminal side of the RdRP. The current knowledge on these additional regions, either in three-dimensional (3D) structure or in function, is quite limited. In the five RdRP-structure available virus families in the positive-strand RNA viruses, only the Flaviviridae family has the 3D structural information resolved for such regions. Hence, future efforts to solve full-length RdRP structures containing these regions and to dissect the functional contribution of them are necessary to improve the overall understanding of the RdRP proteins as an evolutionarily integrated group, and our analyses here may serve as a guideline for selecting representative RdRP systems in these studies.",2019-08-22,"Jia,Hengxia;Gong,Peng",FrontMicrobiol,201116839,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01945;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507560/,0bnfugdm,

Despite the widespread use of inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, the emergence of antigenic variants and the influence of maternal antibodies have raised some concerns regarding the efficacy of commercial vaccines. While no specific antiviral therapy for CPV infection exists, the only treatment option for the infection is supportive therapy based on symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent medical need to develop antiviral therapeutic options to reduce the burden of CPV-related disease. In this study, a cytopathic effect (CPE)-based high-throughput screening assay was used to screen CPV inhibitors from a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library. After two rounds of screening, seven out of 1430 screened drugs were found to have >50% CPE inhibition. Three drugs—Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel—with higher anti-CPV effects were further evaluated in F81 cells by absolute PCR quantification and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The inhibitory effects of all three drugs were dose-dependent. Time of addition assay indicated that the drugs inhibited the early processes of the CPV replication cycle, and the inhibition effects were relatively high within 2 h postinfection. Western blot assay also showed that the three drugs had broad-spectrum antiviral activity against different subspecies of three CPV variants. In addition, antiapoptotic effects were observed within 12 h in Nitazoxanide-treated F81 cells regardless of CPV infection, while Closantel Sodium- or Closantel-treated cells had no pro- or antiapoptotic effects. In conclusion, Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel can effectively inhibit different subspecies of CPV.

The rs12252 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the IFITM3 gene in humans was associated with susceptibility to H1N1 influenza in a 2009 pandemic. In addition, overexpression of the IFITM3 protein potently inhibits the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in ducks and chickens. Although chickens are a major host of influenza viruses and the IFITM3 gene participates in the host antiviral system, studies on chicken IFITM3 gene are very rare. To investigate the genetic characteristics of the chicken IFITM3 gene, we performed direct sequencing and alignment in 108 Dekalb White and 72 Ross breeds. We also investigated the genotype and haplotype frequencies and linkage disequilibrium of the IFITM3 gene polymorphisms and evaluated whether the non-synonymous SNPs are deleterious. We found significantly different genotype, allele and haplotypes frequencies between two chicken breeds, Dekalb White and Ross. Furthermore, we compared and analyzed the promoter structure of the chicken IFITM3 gene with that of several species. We found that birds have a long C-terminal domain and inverted topology of the IFITM3 protein compared to mammals. We also identified fourteen genetic polymorphisms in the chicken IFITM3 gene.

The underlying hypothesis of this project was that inhibitors of autophagy reduce VZV infectivity. We selected the vacuolar proton ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 for analysis because of its well-known antiautophagy property of impeding acidification during the late stage of autophagic flux. We documented that bafilomycin treatment from 48 to 72 h postinfection lowered VZV titers substantially (P ≤ 0.008). Because we were unable to define the site of the block in the infectious cycle by confocal microscopy, we turned to electron microscopy. Capsids were observed in the nucleus, in the perinuclear space, and in the cytoplasm adjacent to Golgi apparatus vesicles. Many of the capsids had an aberrant appearance, as has been observed previously in infections not treated with bafilomycin. In contrast to prior untreated infections, however, secondary envelopment of capsids was not seen in the trans-Golgi network, nor were prototypical enveloped particles with capsids (virions) seen in cytoplasmic vesicles after bafilomycin treatment. Instead, multiple particles with varying diameters without capsids (light particles) were seen in large virus assembly compartments near the disorganized Golgi apparatus. Bafilomycin treatment also led to increased numbers of multivesicular bodies in the cytoplasm, some of which contained remnants of the Golgi apparatus. In summary, we have defined a previously unrecognized property of bafilomycin whereby it disrupted the site of secondary envelopment of VZV capsids by altering the pH of the trans-Golgi network and thereby preventing the correct formation of virus assembly compartments. IMPORTANCE This study of VZV assembly in the presence of bafilomycin A1 emphasizes the importance of the Golgi apparatus/trans-Golgi network as a platform in the alphaherpesvirus life cycle. We have previously shown that VZV induces levels of autophagy far above the basal levels of autophagy in human skin, a major site of VZV assembly. The current study documented that bafilomycin treatment led to impaired assembly of VZV capsids after primary envelopment/de-envelopment but before secondary reenvelopment. This VZV study also complemented prior herpes simplex virus 1 and pseudorabies virus studies investigating two other inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi apparatus function: brefeldin A and monensin. Studies with porcine herpesvirus demonstrated that primary enveloped particles accumulated in the perinuclear space in the presence of brefeldin A, while studies with herpes simplex virus 1 documented an impaired secondary assembly of enveloped viral particles in the presence of monensin.",2019-08-13,"Girsch,JamesH.;Walters,Katherine;Jackson,Wallen;Grose,Charles",JVirol,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6694825/,1qbklvqy,

Since the beginning of October 2018, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has occurred, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used available data on the current outbreak, with case-count time series from prior outbreaks, to project the short-term and long-term course of the outbreak. METHODS: For short- and long-term projections, we modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process that assumes gradually quenching transmission rates estimated from past EVD outbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course of the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We used two regression models to estimate similar projection periods. Short- and long-term projections were estimated using negative binomial autoregression and Theil-Sen regression, respectively. We also used Gott’s rule to estimate a baseline minimum-information projection. We then constructed an ensemble of forecasts to be compared and recorded for future evaluation against final outcomes. From August 20, 2018 to February 25, 2019, short-term model projections were validated against known case counts. RESULTS: During validation of short-term projections, from one week to four weeks, we found models consistently scored higher on shorter-term forecasts. Based on case counts as of February 25, the stochastic model projected a median case count of 933 cases by February 18 (95% prediction interval: 872–1054) and 955 cases by March 4 (95% prediction interval: 874–1105), while the auto-regression model projects median case counts of 889 (95% prediction interval: 876–933) and 898 (95% prediction interval: 877–983) cases for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range from 953 to 1,749. Although the outbreak is already larger than all past Ebola outbreaks other than the 2013–2016 outbreak of over 26,000 cases, our models do not project that it is likely to grow to that scale. The stochastic model estimates that vaccination coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its trial setting in Sierra Leone. CONCLUSIONS: Our projections are concentrated in a range up to about 300 cases beyond those already reported. While a catastrophic outbreak is not projected, it is not ruled out, and prevention and vigilance are warranted. Prospective validation of our models in real time allowed us to generate more accurate short-term forecasts, and this process may prove useful for future real-time short-term forecasting. We estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under target levels of 62% coverage due to contact tracing and vaccination, and this model estimate may offer a surrogate indicator for the outbreak response challenges.",2019-08-05,"Worden,Lee;Wannier,Rae;Hoff,NicoleA.;Musene,Kamy;Selo,Bernice;Mossoko,Mathias;Okitolonda-Wemakoy,Emile;MuyembeTamfum,JeanJacques;Rutherford,GeorgeW.;Lietman,ThomasM.;Rimoin,AnneW.;Porco,TravisC.;Kelly,J.Daniel",PLoSNeglTropDis,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6695208/,1lg2203q,

Although the majority of MERS-CoV cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, the overall risk in areas outside the Middle East remains significant as inside Saudi Arabia. Additional pandemics of MERS-CoV are expected, and thus novel tools and reagents for therapy and diagnosis are urgently needed. Here, we used phage display to develop novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target MERS-CoV. A human Fab phage display library was panned against the S2 subunit of the MERS-CoV spike protein (MERS-S2P), yielding three unique Fabs (S2A3, S2A6, and S2D5). The Fabs had moderate apparent affinities (Half maximal effective concentration (EC(50) = 123–421 nM) for MERS-S2P, showed no cross-reactivity to spike proteins from other CoVs, and were non-aggregating and thermostable (T(m) = 61.5–80.4 °C). Reformatting the Fabs into IgGs (Immunoglobulin Gs) greatly increased their apparent affinities (K(D) = 0.17–1.2 nM), presumably due to the effects of avidity. These apparent affinities were notably higher than that of a previously reported anti-MERS-CoV S2 reference mAb (K(D) = 8.7 nM). Furthermore, two of the three mAbs (S2A3 and S2D5) bound only MERS-CoV (Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)) and not other CoVs, reflecting their high binding specificity.

A 2-year investment period is needed for replacement female heifers to grow before entering the milking herd. The management of replacements over this 2-year period can vary greatly among operations, making it difficult to compare producers’ cost to benchmark. The objective of this project was to develop a model to calculate the cost of rearing a replacement heifer from birth to weaning under different housing, milk source, allotments, and labor and health management decisions to be used as a dairy farm decision support tool. We calculated the cost for management options with general cost values. We found that the average feed cost represented 46% of the total cost while labor, and fixed and variable costs represented 33%, 9%, and 12%, respectively. The total cost increased as milk allotment increased, but cost per Kg of gain decreased. The ranges in total cost within each management scenario often exceed the difference in cost from one scenario to the next. In conclusion, variable costs have the potential to vary among operations, playing a major role in the total cost of rearing replacements from birth to weaning. ABSTRACT: Dairy calves are raised in various housing and feeding environments on dairy farms around North America. The objective of this study was to develop a simulation model to calculate the cost of raising replacement dairy heifers using different inputs that reflect different management decisions and evaluate their influence on the total cost. In this simulation, 84 calves were modeled between 0–2 months of age to reflect a 1000 heifer herd. The decisions associated with housing, liquid diet source and allowance, labor utilization, and health were calculated. Costs and biological responses were reflective of published surveys, literature, and market conditions. A 10,000-iteration economic simulation was used for each management scenario using @Risk and PrecisionTree add-ons (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, USA) to account for variation in pre-weaning mortality rate, weaning age, and disease prevalence. As milk allotment increased, total feed cost increased. Feeding calves a higher allowance of milk resulted in a lower cost per kg of gain. Average feed cost percentage of the total cost was 46% (min, max: 33%, 59%) while labor, and fixed and variable cost represented 33% (20%, 45%), 9% (2%, 12%), and 12% (10%, 14%), respectively.

Peak detection of S. pneumoniae was noted at the same time as the peak in detection of respiratory viruses (OR = 1.01, 95% C.I., 1.00–1.01; P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: We identified distinct seasonal variation in detection of respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens. C. difficile seasonality may, in part, be related to antibiotic prescriptions filled; GNB seasonality may be related to ambient temperature and S. pneumoniae may be related to concurrent respiratory viral infections.

Although rapid diagnostic and public health measures are currently being implemented, new cases of MERS-CoV infection are still being reported. Therefore, various effective measures should be taken to prevent the serious impact of similar epidemics in the future. Further investigation of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the virus, as well as the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic anti-MERS-CoV infections, is necessary. For this purpose, detailed information on MERS-CoV proteins is needed. In this review, we describe the major structural and nonstructural proteins of MERS-CoV and summarize different potential strategies for limiting the outbreak of MERS-CoV.

A wide range of in vitro measures of antibody activity, from neutralization to antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)—each of these terms representing only an operational notion defined by the particulars of a given assay—are poised for assignment of both relevance and reliability in forecasting outcomes of infection. Of the several emergent technical opportunities for clarity, attention here is drawn to three realms: the increasing array of known modifications that can be engineered into Abs to affect their in vivo activities; the improvement of murine models involving knockouts and knock-ins of host genes including Fc receptors; and the development of additional virological design tools to differentiate Abs that act primarily by inhibiting viral entry from antibodies that mainly target viral antigens (Ags) on cell surfaces.

Prefusion-stabilized RSV F variants have been engineered as vaccine antigens, but crystal structures of these variants have revealed conformational differences in a key antigenic site located at the apex of the trimer, referred to as antigenic site Ø. Currently, it is unclear if flexibility in this region is an inherent property of prefusion RSV F or if it is related to inadequate stabilization of site Ø in the engineered variants. Therefore, we set out to investigate the conformational flexibility of antigenic site Ø, as well as the ability of the human immune system to recognize alternative conformations of this site, by determining crystal structures of prefusion RSV F bound to neutralizing human-derived antibodies AM22 and RSD5. Both antibodies bound with high affinity and were specific for the prefusion conformation of RSV F. Crystal structures of the complexes revealed that the antibodies recognized distinct conformations of antigenic site Ø, each diverging at a conserved proline residue located in the middle of an α-helix. These data suggest that antigenic site Ø exists as an ensemble of conformations, with individual antibodies recognizing discrete states.

Serum exosomes are nanovesicles that have multiple biological functions, playing roles in antigen presentation, intercellular signal communication, inflammatory response and immune surveillance. However, the biological functions and related molecular bases remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the profiles of cytokines/chemokines harbored in the exosomes of septic mice and explored the mechanisms of immunomodulation on T cells treated with exosomes harvested from septic mice. Blood cytokines/chemokines existed in both the soluble form and in the insoluble exosomal form; the profiles of the cytokines/chemokines in these two forms displayed different dynamics in the blood of mice challenged with LPS. Exosomes from septic mice induced the differentiation of Th1/Th2 cells, which was blocked by specific antibodies targeting IL-12 and IL-4. In addition, these exosomes significantly augmented the proliferation and migration of T lymphocytes. Furthermore, preadministration of exosomes by intravenous injection restrained the inflammatory response, attenuated lung and liver tissue damage, and prolonged the survival of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice. Our results indicate that exosomes enriched with cytokines/chemokines play critical roles in T cell differentiation, proliferation and chemotaxis during the sepsis process and have a protective effect on cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice.

Here, we show that host tripartite motif-containing protein 56 (TRIM56) poses a barrier to ZIKV infection in cells of neural, epithelial and fibroblast origins. Overexpression of TRIM56, but not an E3 ligase-dead mutant or one lacking a short C-terminal portion, inhibited ZIKV RNA replication. Conversely, depletion of TRIM56 increased viral RNA levels. Although the C-terminal region of TRIM56 bears sequence homology to NHL repeat of TRIM-NHL proteins that regulate miRNA activity, knockout of Dicer, which abolishes production of miRNAs, had no demonstrable effect on ZIKV restriction imposed by TRIM56. Rather, we found that TRIM56 is an RNA-binding protein that associates with ZIKV RNA in infected cells. Moreover, a recombinant TRIM56 fragment comprising the C-terminal 392 residues captured ZIKV RNA in cell-free reactions, indicative of direct interaction. Remarkably, deletion of a short C-terminal tail portion abrogated the TRIM56-ZIKV RNA interaction, concomitant with a loss in antiviral activity. Altogether, our study reveals TRIM56 is an RNA binding protein that acts as a ZIKV restriction factor and provides new insights into the antiviral mechanism by which this E3 ligase tackles flavivirus infections.",2019-06-28,"Yang,Darong;Li,NanL.;Wei,Dahai;Liu,Baoming;Guo,Fang;Elbahesh,Husni;Zhang,Yunzhi;Zhou,Zhi;Chen,Guo-Yun;Li,Kui",PLoSNeglTropDis,195759762,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251739/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007537,1nr0hggt,

Moreover, polymorphisms in IFITM3 have been associated with the severity of the disease in humans. IFITM3 appears to act early in the infection, but its mechanism of action and potential interactions with incoming IAV structures are not yet defined. Here, we visualized endogenous IFITM3 interactions with IAV in the human lung epithelial cell line A549 and in primary human airway epithelial cells employing stimulated emission depletion super-resolution microscopy. By applying an iterative approach for the cluster definition and computational cluster analysis, we found that IFITM3 reorganizes into clusters as IAV infection progresses. IFITM3 cluster formation started at 2-3 h post infection and increased over time to finally coat IAV-containing endosomal vesicles. This IAV-induced phenotype was due to the endosomal recruitment of IFITM3 rather than to an overall increase in the IFITM3 abundance. While the IAV-induced IFITM3 clustering and localization to endosomal vesicles was comparable in primary human airway epithelial cells and the human lung epithelial cell line A549, the endogenous IFITM3 signal was higher in primary cells.

SARS pathology is propagated both by direct cytotoxic effects of the virus and aberrant activation of the innate immune response. Here, we identify several mechanisms by which a SARS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) activates intracellular stress pathways and targets the innate immune response. We show that ORF8b forms insoluble intracellular aggregates dependent on a valine at residue 77. Aggregated ORF8b induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, lysosomal damage, and subsequent activation of the master regulator of the autophagy and lysosome machinery, Transcription factor EB (TFEB). ORF8b causes cell death in epithelial cells, which is partially rescued by reducing its ability to aggregate. In macrophages, ORF8b robustly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by providing a potent signal 2 required for activation. Mechanistically, ORF8b interacts directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3 and localizes with NLRP3 and ASC in cytosolic dot-like structures. ORF8b triggers cell death consistent with pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. While in those cells lacking NLRP3 accumulating ORF8b cytosolic aggregates cause ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase-independent cell death.",2019-06-05,"Shi,Chong-Shan;Nabar,NeelR.;Huang,Ning-Na;Kehrl,JohnH.",CellDeathDiscov,174809342,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-019-0181-7;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231549/,0fpa1f30,

This work explores how protein states can be manipulated through controllability analysis: the determination of the minimum manipulation needed to drive the cell system to any desired state. Here, we complete a two-part controllability analysis of two protein networks: a host network representing the healthy cell state and an influenza A virus-host network representing the infected cell state. In this context, controllability analyses aim to identify key regulating host factors of the infected cell’s progression. This knowledge can be utilized in further biological analysis to understand disease dynamics and isolate proteins for study as drug target candidates. RESULTS: Both topological and controllability analyses provide evidence of wide-reaching network effects stemming from the addition of viral-host protein interactions. Virus interacting and driver host proteins are significant both topologically and in controllability, therefore playing important roles in cell behavior during infection. Functional analysis finds overlap of results with previous siRNA studies of host factors involved in influenza replication, NF-kB pathway and infection relevance, and roles as interferon regulating genes. 24 proteins are identified as holding regulatory roles specific to the infected cell by measures of topology, controllability, and functional role. These proteins are recommended for further study as potential antiviral drug targets. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal outbreaks of influenza A virus are a major cause of illness and death around the world each year with a constant threat of pandemic infection. This research aims to increase the efficiency of antiviral drug target discovery using existing protein-protein interaction data and network analysis methods. These results are beneficial to future studies of influenza virus, both experimental and computational, and provide evidence that the combination of topology and controllability analyses may be valuable for future efforts in drug target discovery.

Infection/contamination with many agents i.e., bacterial, parasitic and viral entities can result in foodborne illness. This article will focus mainly on viral agents of infection. A range of different viruses can cause food poisoning/foodborne infection, and infection can result in a myriad of symptoms, ranging from mild, acute disease to chronic, debilitating disease and even death. Due to the inherent differences between bacteria and viruses, namely the fact that viruses do not replicate in food, while bacteria do, viruses are frequently difficult to detect. This is compounded by the fact that many of the viruses associated with enteric disease do not replicate in cell culture. These factors can lead to a lag between reporting, detection and analysis of foodborne viruses versus bacterial agents. Despite these constraints, it is now evident that there are both well-established and emerging viruses implicated in foodborne infections, and the role of molecular detection and characterisation is becoming increasingly important.",2019-05-21,"O’Shea,Helen;Blacklaws,BarbaraA.;Collins,PatrickJ.;McKillen,John;Fitzgerald,Rose",ReferenceModuleinLifeSciences,187468192,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128096338902735;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128096338902735,1fle5fpz,

Immunization of an HIV V2-apex bnAb precursor Ab-expressing knockin mouse with the chimpanzee MT145K trimer induces HIV V2-specific neutralizing responses.

An acute release of these components occurs when pneumococcal infection is treated with β-lactam antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that non-lytic rifampicin compared with lytic β-lactam antibiotic treatment would attenuate the inflammatory response in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. METHODS: In the PRISTINE (Pneumonia treated with RIfampicin aTtenuates INflammation) trial, a randomized, therapeutic controlled, exploratory study in patients with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, we looked at LTA release and inflammatory and clinical response during treatment with both rifampicin and β-lactam compared with treatment with β-lactam antibiotics only. The trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR3751 (European Clinical Trials Database number 2012-003067-22). RESULTS: Forty-one patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included; 17 of them had pneumococcal pneumonia. LTA release, LTA-mediated inflammatory responses, clinical outcomes, inflammatory biomarkers and transcription profiles were not different between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The PRISTINE study demonstrated the feasibility of adding rifampicin to β-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, but, despite solid in vitro and experimental animal research evidence, failed to demonstrate a difference in plasma LTA concentrations and subsequent inflammatory and clinical responses. Most likely, an inhibitory effect of human plasma contributes to the low immune response in these patients.

Since 2010, the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and US CDC have conducted surveillance to detect known and new etiologies of severe pneumonia. METHODS: Surveillance for severe community-acquired pneumonia was initiated in December 2010 among 30 hospitals in 17 provinces covering all regions of Thailand. Interlinked clinical, laboratory, pathological and epidemiological components of the network were created with specialized guidelines for each to aid case investigation and notification. Severe pneumonia was defined as chest-radiograph confirmed pneumonia of unknown etiology in a patient hospitalized ≤48 h and requiring intubation with ventilator support or who died within 48 h after hospitalization; patients with underlying chronic pulmonary or neurological disease were excluded. Respiratory and pathological specimens were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine viruses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 14 bacteria. Cases were reported via a secure web-based system. RESULTS: Of specimens from 972 cases available for testing during December 2010 through December 2015, 589 (60.6%) had a potential etiology identified; 399 (67.8%) were from children aged < 5 years. At least one viral agent was detected in 394 (40.5%) cases, with the most common of single vial pathogen detected being respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (110/589, 18.7%) especially in children under 5 years. Bacterial pathogens were detected in 341 cases of which 67 cases had apparent mixed infections. The system added MERS-CoV testing in September 2012 as part of Thailand’s outbreak preparedness; no cases were identified from the 767 samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced surveillance improved the understanding of the etiology of severe pneumonia cases and improved the MOPH’s preparedness and response capacity for emerging respiratory pathogens in Thailand thereby enhanced global health security.

An analysis of 480 BALF samples was performed in patients with hematological malignancies over a period of 7 years. The results of culture methods, PCR, and immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate assays for Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) in BALF were analyzed. Further, the diagnostic thresholds for Aspergillus GM and Pneumocystis jiroveci were also calculated. Microbiological findings were present in 87% of BALF samples. Possible infectious pathogens were detected in 55% of cases; 32% were classified as colonizing. No significant difference in diagnostic yield or pathogen spectrum was found between non-neutropenic and neutropenic patients. There was one significant difference in BALF findings among intensive care units (ICU) versus non-ICU patients for Aspergillus spp. (22% versus 9%, p = 0.03). The most common pathogens were Aspergillus spp. (n = 86, 33% of BAL with causative pathogens) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 46, 18%); polymicrobial etiology was documented in 20% of cases. A quantitative PCR value of > 1860 cp/mL for Pneumocystis jirovecii was set as a diagnostic threshold for pneumocystis pneumonia. The absorbance index of GM in BALF of 0.5 was set as a diagnostic threshold for aspergillosis. The examination of BAL fluid revealed the presence of pathogen in more than 50% of cases and is, therefore, highly useful in this regard when concerning pulmonary infiltrates.

We evaluated the anti-T. gondii effects of ursolic acid, and analyzed the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokines through co-cultured immune cells, as well as the expression of intracellular organelles of T. gondii. The subcellular organelles and granules of T. gondii, particularly rhoptry protein 18, microneme protein 8, and inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein 3, were markedly decreased when T. gondii was treated with ursolic acid, and their expressions were effectively inhibited. Furthermore, ursolic acid effectively increased the production of NO, ROS, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon-β, while reducing the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in T. gondii-infected immune cells. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid not only causes anti-T. gondii activity/action by effectively inhibiting the survival of T. gondii and the subcellular organelles of T. gondii, but also induces specific immunomodulatory effects in T. gondii-infected immune cells. Therefore, this study indicates that ursolic acid can be effectively utilized as a potential candidate agent for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis drugs, and has immunomodulatory activity.",2019-05-09,"Choi,WonHyung;Lee,InAh",Pathogens,149455572,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075881/;https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens8020061,26d8o1xk,

It is very important to explore novel biomarkers to better clarify the characteristics of TNBC. It has been reported that polymorphisms in claudin 1 (CLDN1) are associated with risk of several cancers. But till now, there is no report about these polymorphisms and TNBC. Patients and methods: Between January 2004 and December 2013, 267 patients with stage I–III primary TNBC were included in our study. We investigated the association between polymorphisms in CLDN1 gene and clinicopathological characteristics or survival of these patients. We used Haploview 4.2 software to identify Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). MassARRAY MALDI-TOF System was used for genotyping. Results: We found that rs10513846 GA genotype was associated with older age [P=0.013, hazard ratios (HR) = 2.231, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.186–4.195].

Moreover, we identified the miR-1306 core promoter and found three potential SMAD4-binding elements (SBEs). Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that the transcription factor SMAD4 directly binds to the miR-1306 core promoter and inhibits its transcriptional activity.

Immune response plays a key role in driving the course of L. infantum infection in other host species; however, the feline cell-mediated immune response to L. infantum infection has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the cell-mediated immune response specific to L. infantum by means of interferon (IFN)-γ release in whole blood assay from cats living in endemic areas (66 in Sicily and 113 in Catalonia) and to compare with antibody levels to L. infantum [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)], blood parasite load and retroviral infections. RESULTS: Most cats (n = 140) were L. infantum antibody negative and only 22% (n = 39) were positive. Only 9 and 2% of tested cats had a feline immunodeficency virus (FIV) infection or a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, respectively. Thirty-two cats out of 179 (18%) produced IFN-γ after stimulation with L. infantum soluble antigen (LSA) while the majority of cats (93%) produced IFN-γ after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA). Six LSA-IFN-γ-producer cats were seropositive (three to ELISA and five to IFAT) but they were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative, while only one cat was antibody- and PCR-positive. Significant positive correlations were found between IFN-γ concentrations after stimulation with LSA and ConA, and between serology and PCR testing. No association was found between FIV status and LSA or ConA-IFN-γ production. Combining PCR, serology and specific IFN-γ concentration results, we found that 36% of cats studied were exposed to L. infantum. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, cats from endemic areas produce IFN-γ after ex vivo blood stimulation with LSA and therefore are able to activate a cell-mediated adaptive immune response against the parasite that is variably associated with antibody or blood PCR positivity.

The reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial including improved survival of preterm infants. AIM: To assess the severity of viral bronchiolitis in preterm compared to term infants admitted at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt, based on the outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted throughout a 3-year period from September 2011 to October 2014. It included 153 infants, 74 healthy preterm, and 79 healthy term infants admitted with clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) was recorded, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from each patient at the time of presentation. Viruses were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The clinical course and patient’s outcome were recorded. RESULTS: This study recorded a significantly more severe BSS for preterm compared to term infants. The preterm group had an increased mean length of hospital stay and oxygen therapy and was more likely to need intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation (MV) compared to the term group. The mean (± SD) BSS for infections with h-MPV, RSV, and para-influenza 3 was more significantly severe in preterm compared to term infants. Bacterial co-infection was significantly correlated with severity scoring in both groups. CONCLUSION: Prematurity significantly affects the severity of bronchiolitis, and this underscores the importance of early categorization as a high-risk group on their first visit.

Their relatively high rates of mutation and recombination frequencies allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches. Although Brazil has 18% of global avian species diversity, studies regarding the presence of avian viral diseases in wild birds in South America are scarce. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of the presence of CoVs in 746 wild birds. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were obtained and placed together in vials containing VTM transport medium collected in different regions of Brazil between 2006 and 2013. Screening for viral nucleic acid was performed using conventional RT-PCR and pancoronavirus nested PCR. Positive samples were characterized by partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, and ensuing phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the association between virus epidemiology and bird migration routes. Coronavirus RNA were detected and sequenced from six samples, in which three were related to gammacoronaviruses group and the other three to deltacoronavirus group. Our study documents the presence of CoVs related to avian gamma- and deltacoronaviruses circulating in both urban- and poultry-farm regions of Brazil, implicating wild birds as potential carriers of CoVs which may represent a risk to poultry farms and public health in Brazil.

METHODS: We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study from 2014 to 2016 in Biliran Province, the Philippines, on children <5 years old. We collected nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) during household visits and at health facilities. In households (n = 181) with RSV-positive ARI cases (RSV-ARI), we also identified ARI episodes among other children <5 years old in the same household. In addition, we determined the serial interval to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)), the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case. RESULTS: In the 181 households analyzed, we found 212 RSV-ARI in 152 households with a single case and 29 households with multiple cases, which included 29 1st RSV-ARI and 31 2nd RSV-ARI. We also found possible index cases among children <5 years old in the same household for 29.0% (18 of 62) of young infants with RSV-ARI. The estimated mean serial interval was 3.2 days, and R(0) was estimated to be 0.92–1.33 for RSV-A and 1.04–1.76 for RSV-B, which varied between different times (2014 and 2015) and places.

Moreover, we assess research effort on bats and bat-associated viruses globally, and demonstrate that Western Asia has limited published research and represents a gap for coordinated bat research. The lack of bat research in Western Asia severely limits our capacity to identify and mitigate region-specific threats to bat populations and detect interactions between bats and incidental hosts that promote virus spillover.

We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use. We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model that included reproduction numbers from past Ebola outbreaks and a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the outbreak size and duration conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using high (62%), low (44%), and zero (0%) estimates of vaccination coverage (after deployment). Additionally, we used the time series for 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 to parameterize the Thiel-Sen regression model predicting the outbreak size from the number of observed cases from April 4 to May 27. We used these techniques on probable and confirmed case counts with and without inclusion of suspected cases. Probabilistic projections were scored against the actual outbreak size of 54 EVD cases, using a log-likelihood score. With the stochastic model, using high, low, and zero estimates of vaccination coverage, the median outbreak sizes for probable and confirmed cases were 82 cases (95% prediction interval [PI]: 55, 156), 104 cases (95% PI: 58, 271), and 213 cases (95% PI: 64, 1450), respectively.

An overexpression and knockdown assay indicated that CH25H has significant antiviral action against PEDV, and a CH25H mutant (CH25H-M) that lacks hydroxylase activity also retains antiviral activity to a lesser extent. Furthermore, 25HC had a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against different PEDV strains by blocking viral entry.

In this regard, recent work has been focused on vaccine delivery systems, as an alternative to injectable vaccines, to increase antigen stability and improve overall immunogenicity. In particular, novel strategies based on edible or intradermal vaccine formulations have been demonstrated to trigger both a systemic and mucosal immune response. These novel vaccination delivery systems offer several advantages over the injectable preparations including self-administration, reduced cost, stability, and elimination of a cold chain.

However, the impact of natural colds on children with asthma in the community, particularly in the high-risk urban environment, is less well defined. Objective We hypothesized that children with high-symptom upper respiratory viral infections have reduced airway function and greater respiratory tract inflammation than children with virus-positive low-symptom illnesses or virus-negative upper respiratory tract symptoms. Methods We studied 53 children with asthma from Detroit, Michigan, during scheduled surveillance periods and self-reported respiratory illnesses for 1 year. Symptom score, spirometry, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and nasal aspirate biomarkers, and viral nucleic acid and rhinovirus (RV) copy number were assessed. Results Of 658 aspirates collected, 22.9% of surveillance samples and 33.7% of respiratory illnesses were virus-positive.

The same O. tsutsugamushi genotypes were shared among UFI patients, rodents, and chiggers in a single district indicating that the chiggers found on rodents were also likely responsible for transmitting to people. Serological testing using immunofluorescence assays in UFI samples showed high prevalence (IgM/IgG) of Rickettsia and Orientia pathogens, most notably among samples collected during September–November. Additionally, a higher number of seropositive samples belonged to patients in the working age population (20–60 years old). The results presented in this study demonstrate that the increased risk of human infection or exposure to chiggers and their associated pathogen (O. tsutsugamushi) resulted in part from two important factors; working age group and seasons for rice cultivation and harvesting. Evidence of pathogen exposure was shown to occur as there was seropositivity (IgG) in UFI patients for bartonellosis as well as for anaplasmosis. Using a metagenomic approach, this study demonstrated the circulation and transmission of several pathogens in the environment, some of which are known causative agents of illness in human populations.",2019-02-26,"Takhampunya,Ratree;Korkusol,Achareeya;Pongpichit,Chalermpol;Yodin,Komsan;Rungrojn,Artharee;Chanarat,Nitima;Promsathaporn,Sommai;Monkanna,Taweesak;Thaloengsok,Sasikanya;Tippayachai,Bousaraporn;Kumfao,Naruemon;Richards,AllenL.;Davidson,SilasA.",FrontMicrobiol,67870550,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30863381/;https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00319,0gi6qzw0,

Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis conducted using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in the South Korea. Patients over 65 years old who were newly diagnosed with PD during 2007–2011 were identified. The integrative therapy group was defined as patients treated with both Korean medicine (KM) and biomedicine, and the monotherapy group consisted of patients treated with biomedicine alone. From PD diagnosis to 2013, the prevalence and annual length of hospitalization because of PD and major complications (dementia, depression and pneumonia/sepsis) were analyzed using logistic regression, ANOVA and t-tests after propensity score (PS) matching with a 1:1 ratio. Results: After PS estimation and matching, the cohort used in the analysis included 228 subjects (114 integrative therapy group, 114 monotherapy group). Sex, age, index year, comorbidity, severity of disability, neurologic care, and anti-parkinsonism medication (levodopa, ropinirole, pramipexole, selegiline) were adjusted in both groups. The prevalence of hospitalization due to pneumonia/sepsis was 0.50 times (95% C.I.: 0.26–0.96) lower in the integrative therapy group than the monotherapy group, which was statistically significant (p = 0.038). The prevalence and annual length of total hospitalization and hospitalization because of PD, dementia, and depression in the integrative therapy group showed positive results compared to the monotherapy group, but these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: It has not been clearly identified that integrative therapy with KM and biomedicine for PD management is better treatment for patients compared to biomedicine monotherapy; however, we found a clue of better result in integrated therapy.

Spillover events are rare and several factors must align to create the “perfect storm” that would ultimately lead to a spillover. One of these factors is the increased shedding of virus by bats. Several studies have indicated that bats have unique defense mechanisms that allow them to be persistently or latently infected with viruses. Factors leading to an increase in the viral load of persistently infected bats would facilitate shedding of virus.

The global pig sector, with its size and dichotomy between production type and biosecurity level, is particularly vulnerable to the transmission of transboundary animal diseases such as African and classical swine fever, foot and mouth disease, or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. All of the above pose a constant threat to swine health, mainly as a result of both formal and informal international trade. Inspired in the risk assessment methodology, this paper classifies and provides an overview of the different pig disease introduction and exposure pathways, illustrated with abundant examples. Introduction pathways are classified as formal international trade (by product), informal international trade (by product), and spread through fomites. Formal trade of pigs and pork products is regulated by legislation and measures protecting animal populations from exotic diseases. Much more difficult to control is the transboundary swine disease transmission originating through informal trade, which entails illegal smuggling, but also the informal cross-border transfer of animals and products for personal use or within informal market chains. Meat products are most commonly mentioned, although fomites have also played a role in some cases, with live pigs, being more difficult to smuggle playing a role less frequently. The main exposure pathways are also described with the oral route playing a prominent role. Risk assessments can aid in the identification of pathways of pathogen introduction and exposure. However, quantitative information on informal disease introduction pathways remains very scarce and often incomplete, making it difficult to estimate the actual magnitudes of risks. Nevertheless, this knowledge is deemed essential to set up risk based awareness, prevention and surveillance programs that correspond to reality.",2019-02-22,"Beltran-Alcrudo,Daniel;Falco,JohnR.;Raizman,Eran;Dietze,Klaas",BMCVetRes,67857168,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30795759/;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1800-5,048g7jwq,

RESULTS: A total of 144 BAL specimens from 123 patients were included. CMV DNA was detected in 56 out of 144 BAL fluid specimens and the median CMV DNA load from patients in whom CMV pneumonia was unlikely or could be tentatively ruled out was 1210 (31–68, 920) IU/ml. The frequency of CMV DNA detection and median CMV DNA loads were comparable, irrespective of the attributable cause of pneumonia. Detection of CMV DNA loads in BAL fluid specimens >500 IU/ml was independently associated with pneumonia-attributable mortality.

Methods: A system composed of three chambers connected in series, each one housing one ferret and preventing direct contact, was designed. The chambers were designed to house the ferrets for several days and to study the transmission of viruses from an infected (index) ferret to two naïve ferrets via aerosols and droplets or aerosols only. A particle separator was designed that can be used to modulate the size of the particles traveling between the chambers. The chamber system was validated using standard dust as well as with ferrets infected with influenza A virus. Conclusions: The 50% efficiency cut-off of the separator could be modulated between a 5-µm and an 8-µm aerodynamic diameter.

METHODS: Flowsight® Imaging Flow Cytometry was employed for the detection of DPP4 and immunophenotyping. DPP4 enzymatic activity was measured by a DPPIV-Glo™ Protease Assay kit. FINDINGS: Human monocytes expressed a moderate level of membrane-bound DPP4. Obese patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 had a higher level of monocyte DPP4 expression, in parallel with higher levels of HOMA-IR, blood glucose, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol, compared to those in the non-obese (BMI < 30) patients. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), but not native LDL, up-regulated DPP4 expression on macrophages with a preferential increase in CD36(+) cells. OxLDL mediated DPP4 up-regulation was considerably diminished by Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) knockdown and CD36 deficiency. TRIF deficiency, but not MyD88 deficiency, attenuated oxLDL-induced DPP4 increase. INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests a key role for oxLDL and downstream CD36/TLR4/TRIF in regulating DPP4 expression.

The knockout of PD-L1 had a stronger effect on the functionality of CD8(+) T cells than that of PD-1. Augmented CTL responses were associated with an improved control of FV replication. The strong phenotype of FV-infected PD-L1 knockout mice was independent of the interaction with CD80 as an additional receptor for PD-L1. Furthermore, we performed a detailed analysis of the production of different granzymes in virus-specific CD8(+) T cells and observed that especially the simultaneous production of multiple granzymes in individual T cells (multifunctionality) was under the control of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.

Despite the broad antiviral activity of IFITM3, viruses like Lassa virus (LASV), are fully resistant to its inhibitory effects. It is currently unclear whether resistance arises from a highly efficient fusion machinery that is capable of overcoming IFITM3 restriction or the ability to enter from cellular sites devoid of this factor. Here, we constructed and validated a functional IFITM3 tagged with EGFP or other fluorescent proteins. This breakthrough allowed live cell imaging of virus co-trafficking and fusion with endosomal compartments in cells expressing fluorescent IFITM3. Three-color single virus and endosome tracking revealed that sensitive (IAV), but not resistant (LASV), viruses become trapped within IFITM3-positive endosomes where they underwent hemifusion but failed to release their content into the cytoplasm. IAV fusion with IFITM3-containing compartments could be rescued by amphotericin B treatment, which has been previously shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of this protein. By comparison, virtually all LASV particles trafficked and fused with endosomes lacking detectable levels of fluorescent IFITM3, implying that this virus escapes restriction by utilizing endocytic pathways that are distinct from the IAV entry pathways. The importance of virus uptake and transport pathways is further reinforced by the observation that LASV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion is inhibited by IFITM3 and other members of the IFITM family expressed in target cells. Together, our results strongly support a model according to which IFITM3 accumulation at the sites of virus fusion is a prerequisite for its antiviral activity and that this protein traps viral fusion at a hemifusion stage by preventing the formation of fusion pores.

While a rapid and effective immune response is essential to limit viral spread and mortality, this anti-viral response needs to be tightly regulated in order to limit immune mediated tissue damage. This balance between effective virus control with limited pathology is especially important due to the highly specialized functions and limited regenerative capacity of neurons, which can be targets of direct virus cytolysis or bystander damage. CNS infection with the neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induces an acute encephalomyelitis associated with focal areas of demyelination, which is sustained during viral persistence. Both innate and adaptive immune cells work in coordination to control virus replication. While type I interferons are essential to limit virus spread associated with early mortality, perforin, and interferon-γ promote further virus clearance in astrocytes/microglia and oligodendrocytes, respectively. Effective control of virus replication is nonetheless associated with tissue damage, characterized by demyelinating lesions.

Pathogen RNA can be detected by retinoic‐acid inducible gene I‐like receptors in the cytosol, whereas cytosolic DNA is recognized by DNA sensors such as cyclic GMP‐AMP synthase (cGAS). The resulting local immune response, which is initiated within hours of infection, is able to eliminate many pathogens before they are able to establish an infection in the host. For this reason, all viruses, and some intracellular bacteria and protozoa, need to evade detection by nucleic acid sensors. Immune evasion strategies include the sequestration and modification of nucleic acids, and the inhibition or degradation of host factors involved in innate immune signalling. Large DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, often use multiple viral proteins to inhibit signalling cascades at several different points; for instance herpes simplex virus 1 targets both DNA sensors cGAS and interferon‐γ‐inducible protein 16, as well as the adaptor protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and other signalling factors in the pathway. Viruses with a small genome encode only a few immunomodulatory proteins, but these are often multifunctional, such as the NS1 protein from influenza A virus, which inhibits RNA sensing in multiple ways. Intracellular bacteria and protozoa can also be detected by nucleic acid sensors. However, as the type I interferon response is not always beneficial for the host under these circumstances, some bacteria subvert, rather than evade, these signalling cascades for their own gain.",2018-12-18,"Unterholzner,Leonie;Almine,JessicaF.",Immunology,54166109,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13030;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30499584/,204e8z96,

Rates of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) are comparable to those in high-income countries. The program's evolution has been characterized by ambitious target setting and innovative strategies that have not been widely described. METHODS: We reviewed national and provincial health department archives; analyzed disease surveillance, vaccination coverage, and serosurvey data from 1950 through 2016; and, conducted in-depth interviews with senior Chinese experts involved early VPD control efforts. RESULTS: Widespread immunization began in the 1950s with smallpox, diphtheria, and Bacillus-Calmette Guerin vaccines, and in the 1960s with pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, and Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccines. The largest drops in absolute VPD burden occurred in the 1970s with establishment of the Rural Cooperative Medical System and a cadre of trained peasant health workers whose responsibilities included vaccinations. From 1970 to 1979, incidence per 100,000 population dropped 48% from 3.3 to 1.75 for diphtheria, 50% from 152.2 to 49.4 for pertussis, 77% from 2.5 to 0.6 for polio, 60% from 450.5 to 178.3 for measles, and 72% from 18.0 to 5.1 for JE, averting an average of 4 million VPD cases each year. Until the early 1980s, vaccines were delivered through annual winter campaigns using a coordinated ‘rush-relay’ system to expedite transport while leveraging vaccine thermostability. Establishment of the cold chain system during in the 1980s allowed bi-monthly vaccination rounds and more timely vaccination resulting in rates of diphtheria, pertussis, measles and meningitis falling over 90% from 1980 to 1989, while polio and JE rates fell 40–50%. In the 1990s, progress stalled as financing for public health was weakened by broad market reforms. Large investments in public health and immunizations by the central government since 2004 has led to further declines in VPD burden and increased equity. During 2011–2016, the incidence per 100,000 population was <2.0 for measles and <0.2 for pertussis, JE, meningococcal meningitis, and hepatitis A. From 1992 to 2014, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection in children <5 years fell from 9.7% to 0.3%, a 97% decline. China was certified polio-free in 2000 and diphtheria was last reported in 2006.

Kupffer cells, the major immune cell population involved in innate immune responses, are considered to be central for FH. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is a pro-coagulant protein that is substantially induced in macrophages upon viral infection, and Fgl2 depletion represses murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) infection. Clara cell 10 kDa (CC10) protein is a secretory protein with anti-inflammatory properties in allergic rhinitis and asthma. However, its mechanisms of action and pathogenic roles in other disease are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CC10 in FH and the regulation of Fgl2 by CC10. Methods: A mouse FH model was established by peritoneal injection of MHV-3. The mice received CC10 protein through tail vein injection before viral infection. Survival rate, liver function, liver histology, fibrin deposition, and necrosis were examined. The regulatory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression was investigated using THP-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Results: In the mouse FH model induced by MHV-3, the survival rate increased from 0 to 12.5% in the CC10 group compared to that in the saline-only control group. Meanwhile, the levels of ALT and AST in serum were significantly decreased and liver damage was reduced. Furthermore, hepatic Fgl2, TNF-α, and IL-1β expression was obviously downregulated together with fibrin deposition, and hepatocyte apoptosis was reduced after administration of CC10 protein. In vitro, CC10 was found to significantly inhibit the expression of Fgl2 in IFN-γ-treated THP-1 cells and MHV-3-infected mouse peritoneal macrophages by western blot and real-time PCR. However, there was no direct interaction between CC10 and Fgl2 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. Microarray investigations suggested that HMG-box transcription factor 1 (HBP1) was significantly low in CC10-treated and IFN-γ-primed THP-1 cells. HBP1-siRNA treatment abrogated the inhibitory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells (HUVECs). Conclusion:CC10 protects against MHV-3-induced FH via suppression of Fgl2 expression in macrophages.

Small animal models that support the development of adult parasites have not been identified. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We hypothesized that highly immunodeficient NSG mice would support the survival and maturation of O. volvulus and alteration of the host microenvironment through the addition of various human cells and tissues would further enhance the level of parasite maturation. NSG mice were humanized with: (1) umbilical cord derived CD34(+) stem cells, (2) fetal derived liver, thymus and CD34(+) stem cells or (3) primary human skeletal muscle cells. NSG and humanized NSG mice were infected with 100 O. volvulus infective larvae (L3) for 4 to 12 weeks. When necropsies of infected animals were performed, it was observed that parasites survived and developed throughout the infection time course. In each of the different humanized mouse models, worms matured from L3 to advanced fourth stage larvae, with both male and female organ development. In addition, worms increased in length by up to 4-fold. Serum and urine, collected from humanized mice for identification of potential biomarkers of infection, allowed for the identification of 10 O. volvulus-derived proteins found specifically in either the urine or the serum of the humanized O. volvulus-infected NSG mice.

The direct transmission is considered to be a non-monotone incidence function to describe the psychological effect of some severe diseases among the population when the number of infected hosts is large and/or the disease possesses high case fatality rate. The system has a disease-free equilibrium which is locally asymptomatically stable when the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than unity and may have up to four endemic equilibria. Analytical expression representing the epidemic growth rate is obtained for the system. Sensitivity of the two transmission pathways were compared with respect to the epidemic growth rate. We numerically find that the direct transmission coefficient is more sensitive than the indirect transmission coefficient with respect to R0 and the epidemic growth rate. Local stability of endemic equilibria is studied. Further, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved using Li and Muldowney geometric approach. The explicit condition for which the system undergoes backward bifurcation is obtained. The basic model also exhibits the hysteresis phenomenon which implies diseases will persist even when R0 < 1 although the system undergoes a forward bifurcation and this phenomenon is rarely observed in disease models.

Its enzymatic activity is highly regulated by protein factors, and this regulation can impact on the levels of miRNAs and modulate the behavior of a cell. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of regulation, detailed enzymatic and structural characterization of Dicer are needed. However, these types of studies generally require several milligrams of recombinant protein, and efficient preparation of such quantities of pure human Dicer remains a challenge. To prepare large quantities of human Dicer, we have optimized transfection in HEK293-6E cells grown in suspension and streamlined a purification procedure. RESULTS: Transfection conditions were first optimized to achieve expression levels between 10 and 18 mg of recombinant Dicer per liter of culture. A three-step purification protocol was then developed that yields 4–9 mg of purified Dicer per liter of culture in a single day. From SEC-MALS/RI analysis and negative stain TEM, we confirmed that the purified protein is monomerically pure ( ≥ 98%) and folds with the characteristic L-shape geometry. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 5 nM was measured for Dicer binding to pre-let-7a-1, in agreement with previous reports. However, when probing the cleavage activity of Dicer for pre-let-7a-1, we measured k(cat) (7.2 ± 0.5 min(− 1)) and K(M) (1.2 ± 0.3 μM) values that are much higher than previously reported due to experimental conditions that better respect the steady-state assumption. CONCLUSIONS: The expression and purification protocols described here provide high yields of monomerically pure and active human Dicer. Cleavage studies of a pre-let-7 substrate with this purified Dicer reveal higher k(cat) and K(M) values than previously reported and support the current view that conformational changes are associated with substrate binding. Large quantities of highly pure Dicer will be valuable for future biochemical, biophysical and structural investigations of this key protein of the miRNA pathway.

The global burden of numerous infectious diseases has been significantly reduced, and in some cases, effectively eradicated through the deployment of specific vaccines. However, efforts to develop effective vaccines against infectious pathogens such as influenza, HIV, dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ebola virus, and Zika virus (ZIKV) have proven challenging. Zika virus is a mosquito-vectored flavivirus responsible for periodic outbreaks of disease in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands dating back over 50 years. Over this period, ZIKV infections were subclinical in most infected individuals and resulted in mild cases of fever, arthralgia, and rash in others. Concerns about ZIKV changed over the past two years, however, as outbreaks in Brazil, Central American countries, and Caribbean islands revealed novel aspects of infection including vertical and sexual transmission modes. Cases have been reported showing dramatic neurological pathologies including microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental problems in babies born to ZIKV infected mothers, as well as an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. These findings prompted the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV a public health emergency in 2016, which resulted in expanded efforts to develop ZIKV vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Several ZIKV vaccine candidates that are immunogenic and effective at blocking ZIKV infection in animal models have since been developed, with some of these now being evaluated in the clinic. Additional therapeutics under investigation include anti-ZIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been shown to neutralize infection in vitro as well as protect against morbidity in mouse models of ZIKV infection.

The development of drug-resistant TB during the treatment increases the treatment complexity, and the long-term pulmonary complications after completing treatment raise the epidemic health burden. This study intended to investigate the utilization of Chinese medicine (CM) for respiratory symptoms by patients with a medical history of TB in Taiwan. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of one million individuals who were randomly selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The inclusion criteria of patients (n = 7905) with history of TB (ICD-9-CM codes 010–018 and A02) were: (1) TB diagnosed between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2010 (2) 18 years old or over (3) Clinical records for at least 2 months with complete demographic information (4) Record of treatment with first-line TB medication prescriptions. CM users for conditions other than respiratory discomforts (n = 3980) were excluded. Finally, a total of 3925 TB patients were categorized as: CM users for respiratory discomforts (n = 2051) and non-CM users (n = 1874). RESULTS: Among the 3925 subjects, 2051 (52.25%) were CM users, and 1874 (44.753%) were non-CM users. Female patients and those who were younger (18–39 y/o) and who lived in urbanized areas relatively tended to be CM users (p < .0001). Most of the CM users (1944, 94.78%) received Chinese medicines. The most commonly prescribed herbal formulas and single herbs were Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang and Radix Platycodonis (Jie-Geng), respectively.

ChaC glutathione-specific γ-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) mRNA is differentially expressed in primary human airway epithelial cells from bronchi (hAECBs) from patients with CF and healthy patients at baseline and upon infection with Pa. CHAC1 degrades glutathione and is associated with ER stress and apoptosis pathways. In this study, we examined the roles of CHAC1 in the inflammatory response and apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. First, we confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction that CHAC1 mRNA was overexpressed in hAECBs from patients without CF compared with the expression in hAECBs from patients with CF upon Pa (PAK strain) infection. Moreover, the Pa virulence factors LPS and flagellin were shown to induce CHAC1 expression in cells from patients without CF. Using NCI-H292 lung epithelial cells, we found that LPS-induced CHAC1 mRNA expression was PERK-independent and involved ATF4. Additionally, using CHAC1 small interfering RNA, we showed that reduced CHAC1 expression in the context of LPS and flagellin stimulation was associated with modulation of inflammatory markers and alteration of NF-κB signaling. Finally, we showed that Pa was not able to induce apoptosis in NCI-H292 cells.

METHODS: We reviewed research articles published within the last decade that used digital data to answer epidemiological research questions. Data were abstracted from these articles using a data collection tool that we developed. Finally, we summarized the characteristics of the digital epidemiological studies. RESULTS: We identified six main topic domains: infectious diseases (58.7%), non-communicable diseases (29.4%), mental health and substance use (8.3%), general population behavior (4.6%), environmental, dietary, and lifestyle (4.6%), and vital status (0.9%). We identified four categories for the study purpose: description (22.9%), exploration (34.9%), explanation (27.5%), and prediction and control (14.7%). We identified eight categories for the data sources: web search query (52.3%), social media posts (31.2%), web portal posts (11.9%), webpage access logs (7.3%), images (7.3%), mobile phone network data (1.8%), global positioning system data (1.8%), and others (2.8%).

There are two FCoV serotypes. Both type I and II FCoV can replicate in Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf)-4 cells, but the replicability of type I FCoV in feline cell lines is lower than that of type II FCoV, the reason for which is unclear. Inhibition of IFNβ production by non-structural and structural proteins, excluding spike protein has been reported in many coronavirus infections. In this study, we investigated whether IFNβ is involved in the difference in replicability in feline cell lines between types I and II FCoV. When fcwf-4 cells were infected with FCoV, the virus titer of type II FCoV in the culture supernatant was higher than that of type I FIPV. When the IFNβ expression level in FCoV-infected fcwf-4 cells was semi-quantitatively analyzed, infection with type I FIPV, excluding type I FIPV UCD-1, highly induced IFNβ expression. In contrast, induction of IFNβ by type II FCoV infection was significantly lower than that by type I FIPV. In addition, when fcwf-4 cells were adsorbed by FIPV and then stimulated with Poly(I:C), type II FCoV infection inhibited Poly(I:C)-induced IFNβ gene expression. Also, the proliferation of type I FIPV was enhanced by a IFN inhibitor. These findings clarified that, unlike type I FIPV, type II FCoV strongly inhibits IFNβ expression in infected cells.

Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical value of FCSQ theory were reviewed. Multiple databases (China Network Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wanfang Data, SinoMed, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase) were systematically searched from inception to June 12, 2018. Two authors independently extracted the data and performed a methodological quality assessment of the RCTs. RevMan 5.3 software was used for the data analysis. The effect sizes for the primary outcome measures were expressed as relative risks or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Results A total of 13 RCTs were selected, involving 12 types of diseases and 4695 patients. The methodological quality of the RCTs was generally low. Five studies compared the effectiveness of TCM treatments guided by FCSQ theory with conventional TCM therapies, and the remaining eight studies compared the effectiveness of TCM treatments guided by FCSQ theory with biomedical treatments. All of the RCTs reported that the effectiveness of the treatment intervention was better than that of the intervention in the control group. Conclusion Because of many methodological problems in existing clinical studies, it remains impossible to definitively conclude that FCSQ theory can improve clinical effectiveness. It is difficult to unify the clinical application of FCSQ theory. The feasibility and repeatability of FCSQ as an intervention should be given more attention in future clinical research.

Usually, CNS pathologies are caused by known neurotropic viruses such as measles virus (MV), herpes virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), among others. However, nowadays respiratory viruses have placed themselves as relevant agents responsible for CNS pathologies. Among these neuropathological viruses are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the influenza virus (IV), the coronavirus (CoV) and the human metapneumovirus (hMPV). These viral agents are leading causes of acute respiratory infections every year affecting mainly children under 5 years old and also the elderly. Up to date, several reports have described the association between respiratory viral infections with neurological symptoms. The most frequent clinical manifestations described in these patients are febrile or afebrile seizures, status epilepticus, encephalopathies and encephalitis.

However, the direct identification of viral genomes from clinical specimens using next-generation sequencing (NGS) still has its challenges. As a selected viral nucleic acid extraction method may determine the sensitivity and reliability of NGS, it is still valuable to evaluate the extraction efficiency of different extraction kits using clinical specimens directly. RESULTS: In this study, we performed qRT-PCR and viral metagenomic analysis of the extraction efficiency of four commonly used Qiagen extraction kits: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (VRMK), QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (MVSK), RNeasy Mini Kit (RMK), and RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (RPMK), using a mixed respiratory clinical sample without any pre-treatment. This sample contained an adenovirus (ADV), influenza virus A (Flu A), human parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), human coronavirus OC43 (OC43), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). The quantity and quality of the viral extracts were significantly different among these kits. The highest threshold cycle(Ct)values for ADV and OC43 were obtained by using the RPMK. The MVSK had the lowest Ct values for ADV and PIV3. The RMK revealed the lowest detectability for HMPV and PIV3. The most effective rate of NGS data at 67.47% was observed with the RPMK. The other three kits ranged between 12.1–26.79% effectiveness rates for the NGS data. Most importantly, compared to the other three kits the highest proportion of non-host reads was obtained by the RPMK. The MVSK performed best with the lowest Ct value of 20.5 in the extraction of ADV, while the RMK revealed the best extraction efficiency by NGS analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of viral nucleic acid extraction efficiency is different between NGS and qRT-PCR analysis. The RPMK was most applicable for the metagenomic analysis of viral RNA and enabled more sensitive identification of the RNA virus genome in respiratory clinical samples. In addition, viral RNA extraction kits were also applicable for metagenomic analysis of the DNA virus. Our results highlighted the importance of nucleic acid extraction kit selection, which has a major impact on the yield and number of viral reads by NGS analysis. Therefore, the choice of extraction method for a given viral pathogen needs to be carefully considered.

Smartphone applications (apps) have the potential to enhance surveillance data transmission. METHODS: The Central African Republic (CAR) Ministry of Health and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) conducted a 15-week pilot project to test a disease surveillance app, Argus, for 20 conditions in 21 health centers in Mambéré Kadéi district (MK 2016). Results were compared to the usual paper-based surveillance in MK the year prior (MK 2015) and simultaneously in an adjacent health district, Nana-Mambére (NM 2016). Wilcoxon rank sum and Kaplan-Meier analyses compared report completeness and timeliness; the cost of the app, and users’ perceptions of its usability were assessed. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-one weekly reports sent by app identified 3403 cases and 63 deaths; 15 alerts identified 28 cases and 4 deaths.

Genomic DNA of the CC lines was genotyped with high‐density single nucleotide polymorphic markers. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed a significant (P < 0.05) variation of liver weight between the CC lines, with broad sense heritability (H (2)) of 0.32 and genetic coefficient of variation (CV(G)) of 0.28. Subsequently, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed, and results showed a significant QTL only for females on chromosome 8 at genomic interval 88.61‐93.38 Mb (4.77 Mb).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database from January 1, 1999, to July 31, 2011, were analyzed, and patients with diabetes weaning from dialysis-requiring AKI were identified. Cox proportional hazards models and inverse-weighted estimates of the probability of treatment were used to adjust for treatment selection bias. The outcomes were incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and hospitalized heart failure. RESULTS: Of a total of 6165 patients with diabetes weaning from dialysis-requiring AKI identified, 5635 (91.4%) patients were DPP4i nonusers and 530 (8.6%) patients were DPP4i users. Compared with DPP4i nonusers, DPP4i users had a lower risk of ESRD (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94; P=.04) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.23-0.34; P<.001) after adjustments for CKD, advanced CKD, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use. In contrast, the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and hospitalized heart failure did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSION: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor users had a lower risk of ESRD and mortality than did nonusers among patients with diabetes after weaning from dialysis-requiring AKI.

Given their high lethality, a comprehensive understanding of filoviral pathogenesis is urgently needed. In the present studies, we revealed that the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC1) gene deletion protects vasculature in ex vivo explants from EBOV infection. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 using EPAC-specific inhibitors (ESIs) mimicked the EPAC1 knockout phenotype in the ex vivo model. ESI treatment dramatically decreased EBOV infectivity in both ex vivo vasculature and in vitro vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Furthermore, postexposure protection of ECs against EBOV infection was conferred using ESIs. Protective efficacy of ESIs in ECs was observed also in MARV infection. Additional studies using a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype that expresses EBOV glycoprotein (EGP-VSV) confirmed that ESIs reduced infection in ECs. Ultrastructural studies suggested that ESIs blocked EGP-VSV internalization via inhibition of macropinocytosis.

Examining risk factors for prolonged viral shedding may provide critical insight for the development of novel therapeutics and help inform infection prevention practices. Our objective was to identify risk factors for prolonged shedding of HRV post-HCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected weekly nasal samples from allogeneic HCT recipients from day 0 to day 100 post-transplant, and performed realtime RT-PCR (12/2005 to 2/2010). Subjects with symptomatic HRV infection and a negative test within 2 weeks of the last positive were included. Duration of shedding was defined as time between the first positive and first negative samples. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were used as a proxy for viral load. HRV species were identified by sequencing the 5’ non-coding region. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors associated with prolonged shedding (≥21 days). RESULTS: We identified 38 HCT recipients with HRV infection fulfilling study criteria (32 adults, 6 children). Median duration of shedding was 9.5 days (2-89 days); 18 patients had prolonged shedding. Among 26 samples sequenced, 69% were species A, and species B and C accounted for 15% each; the median shedding duration of HRV did not differ between species (P = 0.17).

The C-terminal conserved region VI (CRVI) of L protein contains a K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad typical for 2’O methyltransferases (MTase). In mononegaviruses, cap-MTase activities have been involved in the 2’O methylation and N7 methylation of the RNA cap structure. These activities play a critical role in the viral life cycle as N7 methylation ensures efficient viral mRNA translation and 2’O methylation hampers the detection of viral RNA by the host innate immunity. The functional characterization of the MTase+CTD domain of Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) revealed cap-independent methyltransferase activities targeting internal adenosine residues. Besides this, the MTase+CTD also methylates, the N7 position of the cap guanosine and the 2’O position of the n1 guanosine provided that the RNA is sufficiently long. Altogether, these results suggest that the filovirus MTases evolved towards a dual activity with distinct substrate specificities. Whereas it has been well established that cap-dependent methylations promote protein translation and help to mimic host RNA, the characterization of an original cap-independent methylation opens new research opportunities to elucidate the role of RNA internal methylations in the viral replication.",2018-09-06,"Martin,Baptiste;Coutard,Bruno;Guez,Théo;Paesen,GuidoC;Canard,Bruno;Debart,Françoise;Vasseur,Jean-Jacques;Grimes,JonathanM;Decroly,Etienne",NucleicAcidsRes,52175424,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky637;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30192980/,243u68j8,

Spinal cord demyelination is also induced following intranasal inoculation with neurotropic MHV strains, however much higher viral doses are required as compared to intracranial inoculation. Recently, it was shown that intranasal administration of low concentrations of proteins leads to significant, rapid accumulation of protein in the optic nerve and in the eye, with only low levels reaching spinal cord and other brain regions. Thus, we examined whether intranasal inoculation with MHV at doses equivalent to those given intracranially could induce optic neuritis—inflammation, demyelination and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the optic nerve with or without inducing spinal cord demyelination. Four week old male C57BL/6J mice were inoculated intracranially with the recombinant demyelinating strain RSA59, or intranasally with RSA59 or the non-demyelinating strain RSMHV2 as control. One month post-inoculation, mice inoculated intracranially with RSA59 had significant myelin loss in both spinal cord and optic nerves, with significant loss of RGCs as well, consistent with prior studies. As expected, intranasal inoculation with RSA59 failed to induce demyelination in spinal cord; however, it also did not induce optic nerve demyelination. No acute inflammation was found, and no viral antigen was detected, in the optic nerve or retina 1 day after inoculation. Results confirm the neurotropic effects of RSA59 following intracranial inoculation, and suggest that direct infection with axonal transport of virus from brain to spinal cord and optic nerve is required to induce demyelinating disease. These studies suggest that MHV does not selectively concentrate in optic nerve and retina to sufficient levels to induce demyelination following intranasal inoculation.

We thus undertook systematic reviews based on key questions (KQs) using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format. The KQs were: Among children with chronic cough (> 4 weeks) after acute viral bronchiolitis, how effective are the following interventions in improving the resolution of cough?: (1) Antibiotics. If so what type and for how long? (2) Asthma medications (inhaled steroids, beta2 agonist, montelukast); and (3) Inhaled osmotic agents like hypertonic saline? Methods We used the CHEST expert cough panel’s protocol and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and GRADE framework.

Interaction of the viral spike (S) surface glycoprotein with the host cell receptor is recognized as the first step of infection and is the main determinant of virus tropism. The mechanisms by which neutralizing antibodies inhibit PEDV have not been defined. Isolating PEDV neutralizing antibodies are crucial to identifying the receptor-binding domains of the viral spike and elucidating the mechanism of protection against PEDV infection. METHODS: B cell hybridoma technique was used to generate hybridoma cells that secrete specific antibodies. E.coli prokaryotic expression system and Bac-to-Bac expression system were used to identify the target protein of each monoclonal antibody. qPCR was performed to analyze PEDV binding to Vero E6 cells with neutralizing antibody. RESULTS: We identified 10 monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology. Remarkably, 4 mAbs (designed 2G8, 2B11, 3D9, 1E3) neutralized virus infection potently, of which 2B11 and 1E3 targeted the conformational epitope of the PEDV S protein. qPCR results showed that both 2B11 and 2G8 blocked virus entry into Vero cells. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that PEDV neutralizing antibody inhibited virus infection by binding to infectious virions, which could work as a tool to find the receptor-binding domains.

Little information is available on the role of major traffic hubs, such as airports, in the transmission of respiratory infections, including seasonal influenza and a pandemic threat. We investigated the presence of respiratory viruses in the passenger environment of a major airport in order to identify risk points and guide measures to minimize transmission. METHODS: Surface and air samples were collected weekly at three different time points during the peak period of seasonal influenza in 2015–16 in Finland. Swabs from surface samples, and air samples were tested by real-time PCR for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43). RESULTS: Nucleic acid of at least one respiratory virus was detected in 9 out of 90 (10%) surface samples, including: a plastic toy dog in the children’s playground (2/3 swabs, 67%); hand-carried luggage trays at the security check area (4/8, 50%); the buttons of the payment terminal at the pharmacy (1/2, 50%); the handrails of stairs (1/7, 14%); and the passenger side desk and divider glass at a passport control point (1/3, 33%).

Microvascular-epithelial exudation of bulk plasma proteins characteristically occurs in asthmatic patients, being especially pronounced in those with severe and exacerbating asthma. Healthy human and guinea pig airways challenged by noninjurious histamine-leukotriene–type autacoids also respond through prompt mucosal exudation of nonsieved plasma macromolecules. Contrary to current beliefs, epithelial permeability in the opposite direction (ie, absorption of inhaled molecules) has not been increased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis or in acutely exuding healthy airways. A slightly increased subepithelial hydrostatic pressure produces such unidirectional outward perviousness to macromolecules. Lack of increased absorption permeability in asthmatic patients can further be reconciled with occurrence of epithelial shedding, leaving small patches of denuded basement membrane. Counteracting escalating barrier breaks, plasma exudation promptly covers the denuded patches. Here it creates and sustains a biologically active barrier involving a neutrophil-rich, fibrin-fibronectin net. Furthermore, in the plasma-derived milieu, all epithelial cell types bordering the denuded patch dedifferentiate and migrate from all sides to cover the denuded basement membrane. However, this speedy epithelial regeneration can come at a cost. Guinea pig in vivo studies demonstrate that patches of epithelial denudation regeneration are exudation hot spots evoking asthma-like features, including recruitment/activation of granulocytes, proliferation of fibrocytes/smooth muscle cells, and basement membrane thickening. In conclusion, nonsieved plasma macromolecules can operate on the intact airway mucosa as potent components of first-line innate immunity responses. Exuded plasma also takes center stage in epithelial regeneration.

In this study, we investigated the importance of the G1-lineage H9N2 A/chicken/Israel/1163/2011 virus as a primary pathogen in layers, analyzing its tropism and binding affinity for the oviduct tissues, and investigating the long-term impact on egg production. Besides causing a mild respiratory infection, the virus replicated in the oviduct of 60% of the hens causing different degrees of salpingitis throughout the organ, in particular at the level of the infundibulum, where the detection of the virus was associated with severe heterophilic infiltrate, and necrosis of the epithelium. Binding affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive region of the oviduct. The drop in egg production was at its peek at 2 weeks post-infection (pi) (60% decrease) and continued up to 80 days pi (35% decrease). On day 80 pi, non-laying birds showed egg yolk peritonitis, and histopathological analyses described profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture, duct ectasia and thinning of the epithelium, while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared normal. Our results show that this H9N2 virus is a primary pathogen in layer hens, and that its replication in the infundibulum is responsible for acute and chronic lesions that limits the effective functionality of the oviduct, compromising the commercial life of birds.

We aimed to systematically document the seasonality of several human infectious disease pathogens in England and Wales, highlighting those organisms that appear weather-sensitive and therefore may be influenced by climate change in the future. METHODS: Data on infections in England and Wales from 1989 to 2014 were extracted from the Public Health England (PHE) SGSS surveillance database. We conducted a weekly, monthly and quarterly time series analysis of 277 pathogen serotypes. Each organism’s time series was forecasted using the TBATS package in R, with seasonality detected using model fit statistics. Meteorological data hosted on the MEDMI Platform were extracted at a monthly resolution for 2001–2011. The organisms were then clustered by K-means into two groups based on cross correlation coefficients with the weather variables. RESULTS: Examination of 12.9 million infection episodes found seasonal components in 91/277 (33%) organism serotypes. Salmonella showed seasonal and non-seasonal serotypes. These results were visualised in an online Rshiny application. Seasonal organisms were then clustered into two groups based on their correlations with weather. Group 1 had positive correlations with temperature (max, mean and min), sunshine and vapour pressure and inverse correlations with mean wind speed, relative humidity, ground frost and air frost. Group 2 had the opposite but also slight positive correlations with rainfall (mm, > 1 mm, > 10 mm).

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric viral disease. The interaction between inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) has been reported. However, little is known about the interaction between inactivated PEDV and DCs in porcine PPs. RESULTS: In this study, for the first time we investigated the role of DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration inactivated PEDV. Firstly, a method to isolate DCs from porcine PPs was established, in which the purity of SWC3a(+)/MHC-II(+) DCs was more than 90%. Our findings clearly indicate that DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration of inactivated PEDV not only stimulated the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, but also secreted cytokines (IL-1, IL-4). Furthermore, the number of DCs and IgA(+) cells in porcine intestinal mucosal significantly increased and the levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibody in the serum and SIgA antibody in the feces increased after oral administration inactivated PEDV.

Ducks are commonly affected by severe diseases, including egg-drop syndrome caused by duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV). The immune mechanisms against DTMUV invasion and infection remain poorly understood. In this study, duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) were infected with DTMUV and harvested at 12 and 24 h post-infection (hpi), and their genomes were sequenced. In total, 911 (764 upregulated and 147 downregulated genes) and 3008 (1791 upregulated and 1217 downregulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were considerably enriched in immune-relevant pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and Hematopoietic cell lineage at both time points. The key DEGs in immune system included those of the cytokines (IFN α2, IL-6, IL-8L, IL-12B, CCR7, CCL19, and CCL20), transcription factors or signaling molecules (IRF7, NF-κB, STAT1, TMEM173, and TNFAIP3), pattern recognition receptors (RIG-I and MDA5), and antigen-presenting proteins (CD44 and CD70). This suggests DTMUV infection induces strong proinflammatory/antiviral effects with enormous production of cytokines. However, these cytokines could not protect DEFs against viral attack. Our data revealed valuable transcriptional information regarding DTMUV-infected DEFs, thereby broadening our understanding of the immune response against DTMUV infection; this information might contribute in developing strategies for controlling the prevalence of DTMUV infection.",2018-08-08,"Yu,Guanliu;Lin,Yun;Tang,Yi;Diao,Youxiang",IntJMolSci,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121397/,254pm5cr,

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of emodin on HepaRG cells and to define the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that emodin evidently inhibited HepaRG cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner by blocking cell cycle progression in the S and G2/M phase and by inducing apoptosis. Emodin treatment also resulted in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which abrogated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The above effects were all suppressed by antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Further studies by western blot analysis howed that emodin upregulated p53, p21, Bax, cyclin E, cleaved caspase-3, 8 and 9, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP).

Olive oil polyphenols are known to induce beneficial effects in several pathological conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and to contrast the proliferation of cancer cells or hypercholesterolemia. Polyphenols are also present in waste products derived from the olive industry: olive mill wastewaters (OMWW) are rich in polyphenols and there is an increasing interest in using OMWW in animal nutrition. OMWW are attributed with positive effects in promoting chicken performance and the quality of food-derived products. However, a tissue-specific transcriptome target analysis of chickens fed with OMWW has never been attempted. RESULTS: We explored the effect of dietary OMWW on the intestinal function in broilers. A morphological analysis of the jejunum revealed that OMWW reduced crypt depth, whereas no significant modifications were observed for villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio. An RNA Sequencing analysis was performed on isolated, intestinal, epithelial cells and 280 differentially expressed genes were found using a count-based approach. An enrichment analysis revealed that the majority of up regulated genes in the OMWW group were over-represented by the regulation of viral genome replication-related GO-Terms, whereas down regulated genes were mainly involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed how an industrial waste product can be recycled as a feed additive with a positive relapse. OMWW dietary supplementation can be a nutritional strategy to improve chicken performance and health, prevent intestinal damage, enhance innate immunity and regulate cholesterol metabolism and fat deposition.

Ten candidate compounds were identified and quercetin was investigated in detail due to its leading effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that quercetin alleviated senescence via the enhancement of cell proliferation and restoration of heterochromatin architecture in WS hMSCs.

Methods Patients with CAP who underwent a CT scan at presentation were retrospectively classified using CT findings into consolidation, GGO and bronchiolitis groups. These 3 groups were compared in terms of clinical parameters and microbiological data. Results A total of 40 patients (2.4%) were allocated to the bronchiolitis group and 46 (2.8%) to the GGO group. The most common pathogen in the bronchiolitis group was Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which was significantly more frequently isolated in this group. The bronchiolitis group was characterized by a higher percentage of cough, a lower percentage of chest pain and lower blood levels of inflammatory markers. Common pathogens in the GGO group were not significantly different from those in the other 2 groups.

Zoonotic bacteria, including Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, and Bartonella species, that infect animals and humans cause various illnesses, such as fever, diarrhea, and related complications. Bacterial diseases in animals can be treated with various classes of antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to drug resistance in infectious agents, e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus; this hampers the treatment of infections in livestock, and such problems are increasing worldwide. Dietary phytochemicals and herbal medicines are useful and viable alternatives to pharmaceuticals because they are economical, effective, non-resistance-forming, renewable, and environmentally friendly. They are small molecules with high structural diversity that cause selective stress to or stimulation of resident microbiota, consequently causing an abundance of such microorganisms; thus, they can be used in preventing various diseases, ranging from metabolic and inflammatory diseases to cancer. In addition, the antioxidant effects of phytochemicals prevent substantial losses in the livestock industry by increasing animal fertility and preventing diseases. Potentially effective plant extracts could be used in combination with antibiotics to decrease the required dose of antibiotics and increase their effectiveness. This strategy can help avoid the side effects of chemical antimicrobials and allow the effective use of phytochemicals for treating diseases. Furthermore, phytochemicals are considered as potential alternatives to antibiotics because of their economical, non-resistance-forming and environmentally friendly properties. Flavonoids such as resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, and phenols such as galangin, puerarin, and ursolic acid are proven to be effective as antimicrobial agents.

We aimed to quantify the total number of infections imported into mainland China by arriving travellers. METHODS: We actively surveyed arriving travellers at all 272 international entry–exit ports in mainland China. Suspected cases were detected through fever screening, medical inspection, self-declaration, and reporting by on-board staff. Participants completed a standardised questionnaire with questions about demographics, their travel itinerary (including detailed information about all countries or regions visited), and clinical manifestations. Nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum samples, faecal samples, vomitus, blood, and serum were collected as appropriate for diagnoses. Diagnosis was made by specific laboratory tests according to the national technical guidelines. Infections were classified as respiratory, gastrointestinal, vector-borne, blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted, or mucocutaneous. We divided arriving travellers into two groups: travellers coming from countries other than China, and travellers coming from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. We integrated surveillance data for 2014–16, calculated incidences of travel-related infections, and compared the frequency of infections among subgroups. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2016, 22 797 cases were identified among 805 993 392 arriving travellers—an overall incidence of 28·3 per million. 45 pathogens were detected in participants: 18 respiratory (19 662 cases), ten gastrointestinal (189 cases), seven vector-borne (831 cases), seven blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted (1531 cases), and three mucocutaneous (584 cases). Both the overall number and incidence of infection were more than five times higher in 2016 than in 2014. Case numbers and incidences also varied substantially by province, autonomous region, and municipality. Overall, 17 643 (77%) infections were detected by fever screening, but 753 (49%) blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections were identified through medical inspection. 14 305 (73%) cases of respiratory infection and 96 (51%) of gastrointestinal infections were in tourists. Tuberculosis, hepatitis A virus, vector-borne, and blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections were common among Chinese labourers who worked abroad. Dengue and malaria were most commonly diagnosed in travellers arriving from Africa. 12 126 (93%) of the 12 985 cases arriving from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan were respiratory infections. Hand, foot, and mouth disease accounted for 2·90% of infections in travellers from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan and 0·31% of infections in international travellers. INTERPRETATION: This report is the first to characterise the profile of travel-related infections among arriving travellers in mainland China.

Analysis of codon usage patterns would contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms and genetic architecture of H. manillensis, which in turn would provide insight into the characteristics of other leeches. We analysed codon usage and related indices using 18,000 coding sequences (CDSs) retrieved from H. manillensis RNA-Seq data. RESULTS: We identified four highly preferred codons in H. manillensis that have G/C-endings. Points generated in an effective number of codons (ENC) plot distributed below the standard curve and the slope of a neutrality plot was less than 1. Highly expressed CDSs had lower ENC content and higher GC content than weakly expressed CDSs. Principal component analysis conducted on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values divided CDSs according to GC content and divided codons according to ending bases. Moreover, by determining codon usage, we found that the majority of blood-diet related genes have undergone less adaptive evolution in H. manillensis, except for those with homologous sequences in the host species. CONCLUSIONS: Codon usage in H. manillensis had an overall preference toward C-endings and indicated that codon usage patterns are mediated by differential expression, GC content, and biological function. Although mutation pressure effects were also notable, the majority of genetic evolution in H. manillensis was driven by natural selection.

Despite this impressive economic development, this growth exists side by side with the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crises and the persisting deficiencies in public health provision in China. Acknowledging the prevailing health problems, the Chinese government has encouraged the development of health non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond to the health challenges and address the gaps in public health provision of the government. HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs have been perceived as the most outstanding civil society group developed in China. Considering the low priority of health policies since the economic reform, the limitation of the “third sector” activity permitted in authoritarian China, together with the political sensitivity of the HIV/AIDS problem in the country, this article aims to explain the proliferation of HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China with the usage of the securitization framework in the field of international relations (IR). METHODS: The research that underpins this article is based on a desk-based literature review as well as in-depth field interviews with individuals working in HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China. Face-to-face interviews for this research were conducted between January and May in 2011, and between December 2016 and January 2017, in China. Discourse analysis was in particular employed in the study of the security-threat framing process (securitization) of HIV/AIDS in China. RESULTS: This article argues that the proliferation of HIV/AIDS-related NGOs in China is largely attributed to the normative and technical effects of HIV/AIDS securitization ushered in by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (hereinafter Global Fund) observed in China. Despite depicting a positive scenario, the development of HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China generated by the international securitization efforts is largely limited. An internal and external factor was identified to verify the argument, namely (1) the reduction of international financial commitments, as well as (2) the fragmentation of HIV/AIDS-focused NGO community in China. CONCLUSIONS: This article shows that international securitization weakened with the rise of Chinese commitment on HIV/AIDS interventions. In other words, HIV/AIDS-related responses delivered by the national government are no longer checked by the global mechanism of HIV/AIDS; thus it is unclear whether these NGOs would remain of interest as partners for the government. The fragmentation of the HIV/AIDS community would further hinder the development, preventing from NGOs with the same interest forming alliances to call for changes in current political environment. Such restriction on the concerted efforts of HIV/AIDS-related NGOs in China would make achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to foster stronger partnerships between the government and civil society difficult, which in turn hindering the realization of ending HIV/AIDS in the world by 2030.",2018-05-16,"Lo,CatherineYuk-ping",GlobalHealth,21727639,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29769102/;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-018-0364-7,1of5ertf,

A major driver of these gene expression changes is a virally encoded, messenger RNA (mRNA)-specific endonuclease termed SOX. SOX cleaves the majority of cytoplasmic mRNAs, but does so at specific internal sites loosely defined by a degenerate sequence motif. If and how RNA sequence directs SOX targeting remained unknown. To address these questions, we used recombinant, highly purified SOX endonuclease in a series of biochemical assays to reconstitute the cleavage reaction in vitro and gain significant insight into the biochemical mechanism of both SOX target recognition and endonucleolytic cleavage. Using this system, we determined that cut site specificity is preserved with purified SOX and a validated target RNA and thus does not require additional cellular cofactors. Furthermore, we showed that SOX displays robust, sequence-specific RNA binding to residues proximal to the cleavage site, which must be presented in a particular structural context. The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of target RNA susceptibility observed in cells. Significance Statement Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic human virus that causes Kaposi’s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease. During viral replication, KSHV expresses an enzyme called SOX that cuts and inactivates the majority of cellular messenger RNAs, preventing their translation into proteins. Some mRNAs are efficiently cleaved by SOX, while others are poorly cleaved, but the mechanistic basis underlying this selectivity has remained largely unknown. Here, we reveal that the efficiency of RNA cleavage is heavily impacted by RNA sequences proximal to the cleavage site, which serve as a SOX binding platform. This helps explain both the range of RNA cleavage efficiency observed in SOX-expressing cells as well as the sequence specificity underlying SOX targeting.",2018-05-13,"Mendez,AaronS.;Vogt,Carolin;Bohne,Jens;Glaunsinger,BrittA.",bioRxiv,196632439,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/320929,298cbr1x,

The primary focus of this study is to predict PPIs between virus and its targeted host, which are involved in viral infection. We developed a general method that predicts interactions between virus and host proteins using the repeat patterns and composition of amino acids. In independent testing of the method with PPIs of new viruses and hosts, it showed a high performance comparable to the best performance of other methods for single virus-host PPIs.

In a previous study, we established an hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model in which MERS-CoV infection causes severe acute respiratory failure and high mortality accompanied by an elevated secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Since excessive complement activation is an important factor that contributes to acute lung injury after viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of complement in MERS-CoV-induced lung damage. Our study showed that complement was excessively activated in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice through observations of increased concentrations of the C5a and C5b-9 complement activation products in sera and lung tissues, respectively. Interestingly, blocking C5a production by targeting its receptor, C5aR, alleviated lung and spleen tissue damage and reduced inflammatory responses. More importantly, anti-C5aR antibody treatment led to decreased viral replication in lung tissues. Furthermore, compared with the sham treatment control, apoptosis of splenic cells was less pronounced in the splenic white pulp of treated mice, and greater number of proliferating splenic cells, particularly in the red pulp, was observed. These data indicate that (1) dysregulated host immune responses contribute to the severe outcome of MERS; (2) excessive complement activation, triggered by MERS-CoV infection, promote such dysregulation; and (3) blockade of the C5a–C5aR axis lead to the decreased tissue damage induced by MERS-CoV infection, as manifested by reduced apoptosis and T cell regeneration in the spleen.

Complete genome sequence analysis revealed that the isolate was genetically distinct from known astroviruses and closely related to members of the avastrovirus genogroup II. Experimental infection showed that the isolate was highly pathogenic in goslings, causing clinical signs, growth repression and in many cases mortality. Histopathological examination indicated that lesions occurred mainly in the kidneys of infected birds.

In this report, we describe a patient who presented with acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and became a MERS-CoV superspreader, igniting a recent multihospital outbreak in Riyadh. MATERIAL AND RESULTS: Between May 31 and June 15, 2017, 44 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported from 3 simultaneous clusters from 3 health care facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, including 11 fatal cases. Out of the total reported cases, 29 cases were reported from King Saud Medical City. The cluster at King Saud Medical City was ignited by a single superspreader patient who presented with acute renal failure. After 14 hours in the open area of the emergency department and 2 hemodialysis sessions he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV. One hundred twenty contacts who had direct unprotected exposure were screened. Among those contacts, 9 out of 107 health care workers (5 nurses, 3 physicians, and 1 paramedic) and 7 out of 13 patients tested positive for MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: This hospital outbreak demonstrated the difficulties in diagnosing pneumonia in patients with renal and cardiac failure, which leads to delayed suspicion of MERS-CoV and hence delay in applying the proper infection control procedures.

As the world’s most populated country and the second biggest economy in the world, China used to have a fragile PHEMS; however, the government took forceful actions to build PHEMS after the 2003 SARS outbreak. After more than one decade’s efforts, we tried to assess the improvements and problems of China’s PHEMS between 2002 and 2012. METHODS: We conducted two rounds of national surveys and collected the data of the year 2002 and 2012, including all 32 provincial, 139 municipal, and 489 county CDCs. The municipal and county CDCs were selected by systematic random sampling. Twenty-one indicators of four stages (preparation, readiness, response and recovery) from the National Assessment Criteria for CDC Performance were chosen to assess the ten-year trends. RESULTS: At the preparation stage, organization, mechanisms, workforce, and stockpile across all levels and regions were significantly improved after one decade’s efforts. At the readiness stage, the capability for formulating an emergency plan was also significantly improved during the same period. At the response stage, internet-based direct reporting was 98.8%, and coping scores were nearly full points of ten in 2012. At the recovery stage, the capabilities were generally lower than expected. CONCLUSIONS: Due to forceful leadership, sounder regulations, and intensive resources, China’s PHEMS has been improved at the preparation, readiness, and response stages; however, the recovery stage was still weak and could not meet the requirements of crisis management and preventive governance.

The results showed that, using the BP-MS method, we could accurately identify the expected bacteria without cross-reactivity with other pathogens. For the 11 target bacterial pathogens, the analytical sensitivity of the BP-MS method was as low as 10 copies/reaction. To further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this method, 204 nasopharyngeal swabs from hospitalized children with suspected pneumonia were tested using this method. In total, 81.9% (167/204) of the samples were positive for at least one of the 11 target pathogens. Among the 167 bacteria-positive samples, the rate of multiple infections was 55.7% (93/167), and the most frequent combination was Streptococcus pneumoniae with Haemophilus influenzae, representing 46.2% (43/93) two-pathogen mixed infections. We used real-time PCR and nested PCR to confirm positive results, with identical results obtained for 81.4% (136/167) of the samples. The BP-MS method is a sensitive and specific molecular detection technique in a multiplex format and with high sample throughput. Therefore, it will be a powerful tool for pathogen screening and antibiotic selection at an early stage of disease.",2018-04-05,"Zhang,Chi;Xiu,Leshan;Xiao,Yan;Xie,Zhengde;Ren,Lili;Peng,Junping",FrontCellInfectMicrobiol,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5895723/,0k2blp7n,

ER stress and activation of the UPR are natural mechanisms by which mucosal epithelial cells combat viral infections.

In some regions of Cameroon, bats are hunted and eaten as a delicacy. This close proximity between human and bats provides ample opportunity for zoonotic events. To elucidate the viral diversity of Cameroonian fruit bats, we collected and metagenomically screened eighty-seven fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus fruit bats. The results showed a plethora of known and novel viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the eleven gene segments of the first complete bat rotavirus H genome, showed clearly separated clusters of human, porcine, and bat rotavirus H strains, not indicating any recent interspecies transmission events. Additionally, we identified and analyzed a bat bastrovirus genome (a novel group of recently described viruses, related to astroviruses and hepatitis E viruses), confirming their recombinant nature, and provide further evidence of additional recombination events among bat bastroviruses. Interestingly, picobirnavirus-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene segments were identified using an alternative mitochondrial genetic code, and further principal component analyses suggested that they may have a similar lifestyle to mitoviruses, a group of virus-like elements known to infect the mitochondria of fungi. Although identified bat coronavirus, parvovirus, and cyclovirus strains belong to established genera, most of the identified partitiviruses and densoviruses constitute putative novel genera in their respective families.

We aimed to determine the proportion of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) among patients with CAP and HN. Moreover, we wished to investigate the relationship between HN and inflammatory markers, bacterial etiology and prognosis in hospitalized children with CAP. METHODS: We carried out a prospective, observational, multicentre, prospective cohort study. Eligible participants were children from 1 month to 17 years old hospitalized due to CAP from 2012 to 2015. RESULTS: A total of 150 children were analyzed. Forty-five (30%) patients had serum sodium levels of less than 135 mmol/L. Patients with HN had significantly higher concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers. They also had significantly lower osmolality and urine sodium. They also had longer hospitalizations and more days of fever. Only 16 out of the 45 (35%) patients with HN had confirmed calculated plasma osmolality (<275 mOsm/kg). Only 5 out of 37 (13%) patients with available measurements of plasma osmolality and urine sodium fulfilled the criteria for SIADH. Among the 16 patients with HN and hypo-osmolality, 15 had a fractional sodium excretion (EFNa) levels of less than 1%. We found a significant inverse linear correlation between serum sodium and C-reactive protein, as well as serum sodium and procalcitonin.

The aim of these 2 studies was to investigate the safety and efficacy of PrEP-001 prophylaxis against rhinovirus (HRV-A16) and influenza-A (H3N2-IAV). METHODS: Healthy subjects randomly received 2 doses of PrEP-001 or placebo, 48 and 24 h pre-challenge with 10 TCID(50) of HRV-A16 (Study 1) or H3N2-IAV (Study 2). RESULTS: In Study 1, PrEP-001 reduced median total symptom score from 38.5 to 4.5 (p = 0.004), median symptom duration from 6.0 to 1.7 days and median mucus production from 15 g to 3 g. The percentage of subjects classified as ill was reduced 3-fold (placebo 73%, PrEP-001 23%, p = 0.002). In Study 2, PrEP-001 reduced median total symptom score from 8.0 to 4.1 (p = 0.021), median symptom duration from 4.6 to 3.7 days and median mucus production from 3.6 g to 1.5 g. The percentage of subjects classified as ill was reduced 2-fold (placebo 48%, PrEP-001 24%, p = 0.064). PrEP-001 reduced peak viral shedding in both studies, as assessed by qRT-PCR of nasal lavage.

This study was performed to evaluate the proportion of adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae among Hajj pilgrims in 2016. To add sensitivity to etiological attribution, a urine antigen test was used in addition to culture-based methods. METHODS: Adult subjects hospitalized with X-ray-confirmed CAP were enrolled prospectively from all general hospitals designated to treat Hajj pilgrims in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Patients were treated according to local standard of care and administered the BinaxNow S. pneumoniae urine antigen test. RESULTS: From August 23 to September 23, 2016, a total of 266 patients with CAP were enrolled in the study, 70.6% of whom were admitted to hospitals in Mecca; 53% of the cases were admitted after the peak of Hajj. Patients originated from 43 countries. Their mean age was 65.3 years and the male to female ratio was 2:1. Just over 36% of the cases had diabetes, 10% declared that they were smokers, and 45.4% of cases were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The overall case-fatality rate was 10.1%, but was higher among those treated in the ICU and in those with invasive disease. The proportion of CAP cases positive for S. pneumoniae, based on culture or urine antigen test, was 18.0% (95% confidence interval 13.9–23.1%).

Effective antibiotic stewardship must include proper prescribing for outpatients as well as for those in a hospital or long-term care facility. METHODS: Major databases, including MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library, were searched for prospective human clinical studies, including children and/or adults published between January 1966 and November 2017 that evaluated Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) as a biomarker for diagnosing viral infections as well as both C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) as potential biomarkers for identifying and differentiating true bacterial upper respiratory infection (URI) from colonization. RESULTS: Ten prospective human studies, totaling 1683 patients, were identified that evaluated MxA as a viral biomarker in children and/or adults. Both systematic review articles, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled clinical trials that examined CRP and/or PCT as a biomarker for identifying clinically significant bacterial infections and supporting antibiotic stewardship were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Quick and accurate differentiation between a viral and bacterial respiratory infection is critical to effectively combat antibiotic misuse.

RSV B strains affected 3 patients, 2 of whom were co-infected with RSV A. Exactly this RSV A strain was detected in another 5 patients. Our multimodal infection control bundle including prophylactic RSV screening was able to rapidly stop the outbreak. CONCLUSION: An infection control bundle in RSV outbreaks should address all potential transmission pathways.

Immunosuppressed macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV and sampled daily for 6 days to assess their immune statues and to measure viral shedding and replication. Immunosuppressed macaques supported significantly higher levels of MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues and shed more virus, and virus disseminated to tissues outside of the respiratory tract, whereas viral RNA was confined to respiratory tissues in non-immunosuppressed animals. Despite increased viral replication, pathology in the lungs was significantly lower in immunosuppressed animals.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the patterns of changes in cytokines and viral load in SFTS patients. STUDY DESIGN: During the admission period of patients, RNA was extracted from plasma and quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, cytokine bead arrays were performed for the 18 cytokines and chemokines selected for testing. RESULTS: The median time from admission to the negative conversion of SFTS viremia was 17.0 days. When censored patients were found to be negative for viral load at discharge, the median duration of viral shedding was 13.0 days (95% CI, 5.4–20.6).

Utilizing a systems-based approach, we examined differential regulation of IFN-γ–dependent genes following infection with robust respiratory viruses including influenza viruses [A/influenza/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1-VN1203) and A/influenza/California/04/2009 (H1N1-CA04)] and coronaviruses [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV)]. Categorizing by function, we observed down-regulation of gene expression associated with antigen presentation following both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Further examination revealed global down-regulation of antigen-presentation gene expression, which was confirmed by proteomics for both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, epigenetic analysis suggested that DNA methylation, rather than histone modification, plays a crucial role in MERS-CoV–mediated antagonism of antigen-presentation gene expression; in contrast, H5N1-VN1203 likely utilizes a combination of epigenetic mechanisms to target antigen presentation. Together, the results indicate a common mechanism utilized by H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV to modulate antigen presentation and the host adaptive immune response.",2018-01-30,"Menachery,VineetD.;Schäfer,Alexandra;Burnum-Johnson,KristinE.;Mitchell,HughD.;Eisfeld,AmieJ.;Walters,KevinB.;Nicora,CarrieD.;Purvine,SamuelO.;Casey,CameronP.;Monroe,MatthewE.;Weitz,KarlK.;Stratton,KellyG.;Webb-Robertson,Bobbie-JoM.;Gralinski,LisaE.;Metz,ThomasO.;Smith,RichardD.;Waters,KatrinaM.;Sims,AmyC.;Kawaoka,Yoshihiro;Baric,RalphS.",ProcNatlAcadSciUSA,4576093,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706928115;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29339515/,096gtdy5,

Virus-specific antibodies have been shown to control virus clearance, but antibodies present at sub-neutralizing concentrations can also augment virus infection that exacerbates disease severity. To explore this occurrence, CHIKV infection was investigated in the presence of CHIKV-specific antibodies in both primary human cells and a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7. Enhanced attachment of CHIKV to the primary human monocytes and B cells was observed while increased viral replication was detected in RAW264.7 cells. Blocking of specific Fc receptors (FcγRs) led to the abrogation of these observations. Furthermore, experimental infection in adult mice showed that animals had higher viral RNA loads and endured more severe joint inflammation in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of CHIKV-specific antibodies. In addition, CHIKV infection in 11 days old mice under enhancing condition resulted in higher muscles viral RNA load detected and death.

Using routine hospital data, we aimed to examine the spatial distribution, temporal trends and climatic risk factors of paediatric ARIs in Vietnam. METHODS: Data from hospitalised paediatric (<16 years) patients with ARIs residing in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) between 2005 and 2010 were retrieved from the two main Children’s Hospitals and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in HCMC. Spatial mapping and time series analysis were performed after disaggregating data into upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs). RESULTS: Over the study period, there were 155 999 paediatric patients admitted with ARIs (33% of all hospital admissions). There were 68 120 URIs (14%) and 87 879 LRIs (19%). The most common diagnoses were acute pharyngitis (28% of all ARI), pneumonia (21%), bronchitis (18%) and bronchiolitis (16%). A significant increasing trend over time was found for both URIs (mean weekly incidence per 1000 population, I=3.12), incidence rate ratio for 1-week increase in time (RR 1.0, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17) for URI and (I=4.02, RR 1.08 (95% CI 1.006 to 1.16)) for LRI. The weekly URI incidence peaked in May–June and was significantly associated with lags in weekly URI incidence and the average humidity, rainfall and water level. The weekly LRI incidence exhibited significant seasonality (P<0.0001), with an annual peak in September–October and was significantly associated with lags in weekly LRI incidence and lags in weekly average temperature, rainfall and water level.

From the 19 compounds, we identified arctigenin (ARG) has the highest inhibition on SVCV replication, with maximum inhibitory percentage on SVCV > 90%. And the 48 h half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of ARG on SVCV glycoprotein and nucleoprotein were 0.29 (0.22–0.39) and 0.35 (0.29–0.41) mg/L respectively. In addition, ARG significantly reduced SVCV-induced apoptosis and recovered SVCV-activated caspase-3/8/9 activity. Further, cellular morphological damage induced by SVCV was blocked by ARG treatment. Mechanistically, ARG did not affect SVCV infectivity. Moreover, ARG could not induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which plays an antiviral role on SVCV. Interestingly, SVCV-induced autophagy which is necessary for virus replication was inhibited by ARG treatment. These results indicated that the inhibition of ARG on SVCV replication was, at least in part, via blocking SVCV-induced autophagy.

To date many subgenotypes have been reported for BVDV-1, currently ranging from subgenotype 1a to subgenotype 1u. While BVDV-1 has a world-wide distribution, the subgenotypes have a more restricted geographical distribution. As an example, BVDV-1 subgenotypes 1a and 1b are frequently detected in North America and Europe, while the subgenotype 1c is rarely detected. In contrast, BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c is by far the most commonly reported in Australia. Despite this, uneven distribution of the biological importance of the subgenotypes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to characterise the in vivo properties of five strains of BVDV-1 subgenotype 1c in cattle infection studies. No overt respiratory signs were reported in any of the infected cattle regardless of strain. Consistent with other subgenotypes, transient pyrexia and leukopenia were commonly identified, while thrombocytopenia was not. The quantity of virus detected in the nasal secretions of transiently infected animals suggested the likelihood of horizontal transmission was very low.

Due to the overwhelming prevalence and incidence rates of HIV, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, it is necessary to develop new and affordable treatments. AIM OF THE STUDY: The article provides an extensive overview of the status on investigation of plants from the southern African region with ethnobotanical use for treating HIV or HIV-related symptoms, or the management of HIV. The review also provide an account of the in vitro assays, anti-viral activity and phytochemistry of these plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peer-reviewed articles investigating plants with ethnobotanical information for the treatment or management of HIV or HIV-related symptoms from the southern African region were acquired from Science Direct, PubMed central and Google Scholar. The selection criteria was that (1) plants should have a record of traditional/popular use for infectious or viral diseases, HIV treatment or symptoms similar to HIV infection, (2) if not traditionally/popularly used, plants should be closely related to plants with popular use and HIV activity identified by means of in vitro assays, (3) plants should have been identified scientifically, (4) should be native to southern African region and (5) anti-HIV activity should be within acceptable ranges. RESULTS: Many plants in Africa and specifically the southern African region have been used for the treatment of HIV or HIV related symptoms and have been investigated suing various in vitro techniques. In vitro assays using HIV enzymes such as reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN) and protease (PR), proteins or cell-based assays have been employed to validate the use of these plants with occasional indication of the selectivity index (SI) or therapeutic index (TI), with only one study, that progressed to in vivo testing. The compounds identified from plants from southern Africa is similar to compounds identified from other regions of the world, and the compounds have been divided into three groups namely (1) flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides, (2) terpenoids and terpenoid glycosides and (3) phenolic acids and their conjugated forms. CONCLUSIONS: An investigation of the plants from southern Africa with ethnobotanical use for the treatment of HIV, management of HIV or HIV-related symptoms, therefore provide a very good analysis of the major assays employed and the anti-viral compounds and compound groups identified. The similarity in identified anti-viral compounds worldwide should support the progression from in vitro studies to in vivo testing in development of affordable and effective anti-HIV agents for countries with high infection and mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS.",2018-01-10,"Prinsloo,Gerhard;Marokane,CynthiaK.;Street,RenéeA.",JEthnopharmacol,11815047,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874117301265;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28807850/;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.08.005;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874117301265,1wqtxc6p,

Despite the availability of vaccines or antiviral drugs, personal hygiene is considered as effective means as the first-hand measure against viral infections. The green tea catechins, in particular, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), are known to exert potent antiviral activity. In this study, we evaluated the green tea extract as a safe personal hygiene against viral infections. RESULTS: Using the influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) as a model, we examined the duration of the viral inactivating activity of green tea extract (GTE) under prolonged storage at various temperature conditions. Even after the storage for 56 days at different temperatures, 0.1% GTE completely inactivated 10(6) PFU of the virus (6 log(10) reduction), and 0.01% and 0.05% GTE resulted in 2 log(10) reduction of the viral titers. When supplemented with 2% citric acid, 0.1% sodium benzoate, and 0.2% ascorbic acid as anti-oxidant, the inactivating activity of GTE was temporarily compromised during earlier times of storage. However, the antiviral activity of the GTE was steadily recovered up to similar levels with those of the same concentrations of GTE without the supplements, effectively prolonging the duration of the virucidal function over extended period. Cryo-EM and DLS analyses showed a slight increase in the overall size of virus particles by GTE treatment. The results suggest that the virucidal activity of GTE is mediated by oxidative crosslinking of catechins to the viral proteins and the change of physical properties of viral membranes. CONCLUSIONS: The durability of antiviral effects of GTE was examined as solution type and powder types over extended periods at various temperature conditions using human influenza A/H1N1 virus. GTE with supplements demonstrated potent viral inactivating activity, resulting in greater than 4 log(10) reduction of viral titers even after storage for up to two months at a wide range of temperatures.

In this study, we found that the PRRSV nsp4 interacted with the mitochondrial inner membrane protein cytochrome c1 (cyto.c1) and induced its proteolytic cleavage. Interestingly, the cleaved N-terminal fragment of cyto.c1 was found to exert apoptotic activity, which could cause mitochondrial fragmentation, resulting in apoptotic cell death. And RNA interference (RNAi) silencing experiments further confirmed the crucial role which cyto.c1 played in nsp4- and PRRSV-induced cell apoptosis.

Therefore, surveillance on the prevalence and the virus variation of HCoVs circulation in this region is conducted. METHODS: A total of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from cross-border children (<6 years, crossing border between Southern China and Hong Kong SAR) showing symptoms of respiratory tract infection, such as fever (body temperature > 37.5 °C), from 2014 May to 2015 Dec. Viral nucleic acids were analyzed and sequenced to study the prevalence and genetic diversity of the four human coronaviruses. The statistical significance of the data was evaluated with Fisher chi-square test. RESULTS: 78 (2.37%; 95%CI 1.8-2.8%) out of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens were found to be positive for OC43 (36;1.09%), HKU1 (34; 1.03%), NL63 (6; 0.18%) and 229E (2;0.01%). None of SARS or MERS was detected. The HCoVs predominant circulating season was in transition of winter to spring, especially January and February and NL63 detected only in summer and fall. Complex population with an abundant genetic diversity of coronaviruses was circulating and they shared homology with the published strains (99-100%). Besides, phylogenetic evolutionary analysis indicated that OC43 coronaviruses were clustered into three clades (B,D,E), HKU1 clustered into two clades(A,B) and NL63 clustered into two clades(A,B). Moreover, several novel mutations including nucleotides substitution and the insertion of spike of the glycoprotein on the viral surface were discovered. CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate and epidemic trend of coronaviruses were stable and no obvious fluctuations were found. The detected coronaviruses shared a conserved gene sequences in S and RdRp.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the most important infectious agents in chickens, and in chicken cells, it can be recognized by MDA5 to activate interferon production. RIG-I is considered to be absent in chickens. However, the absence of RIG-I in chickens raises the question of whether this protein influences the antiviral immune response against IBV infection. RESULTS: Here, we showed that chicken cells transfected with domestic goose RIG-I (dgRIG-I) exhibited increased IFN-β activity after IBV infection. We also found that IBV can cleave MAVS, an adaptor protein downstream of RIG-I and MDA5 that acts as a platform for antiviral innate immunity at an early stage of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Although chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) is functionally active during IBV infection, the absence of RIG-I may increase the susceptibility of chickens to IBV infection, and IBV may disrupt the activation of the host antiviral response through the cleavage of MAVS.

However, most of the reported cases have been singular events. Here, we report a total of five cowpox virus outbreaks in cheetahs in the same safari park in Denmark between 2010 and 2014. Nine cheetahs showed varying severity of clinical disease; two of them died (22%). All episodes occurred between August and October of the respective year. No other carnivores kept at the same institution nor the keepers taking care of the animals were clinically affected. The clinical picture of cowpox was confirmed by extensive laboratory investigations including histopathological and molecular analyses as well as cell culture isolation of a cowpox virus. High anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers were detected in all 9 diseased cheetahs compared to seven contact cheetahs without clinical signs and 13 cheetahs not in direct contact. Additionally, whole genome sequencing from one sample of each cluster with subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from different outbreaks have individual sequences but clearly form a clade distinct from other cowpox viruses. However, the intra-clade distances are still larger than those usually observed within clades of one event. These findings indicate multiple and separate introductions of cowpox virus, probably from wild rodent populations, where the virus keeps circulating naturally and is only sporadically introduced into the cheetahs.

Two approaches were used to collect data: i) technical visits to the facilities involved with border surveillance and application of a questionnaire survey; ii) application of an online questionnaire survey. It was identified that, for both surveillance systems, more than 55% of the technicians had realized that the BES and its activities have high priority. Eighty percent of North American and 71% of Brazilian border jurisdictions reported an exchange of information between countries. Less than half of the jurisdictions reported that the necessary tools to carry out information exchange were available. Operational attributes of completeness, feedback, reciprocity, and quality of information were identified as weak or of low quality in both systems.

In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that wolves are susceptible to CaKoV infections. A total of 185 wolf stool samples were collected from necropsied animals and from transects in the Liguria, Piemonte and Valle D’Aosta regions of Italy, and CaKoV RNA was identified in two of these specimens.

The host-constrained perception of viruses implies preference of genetic exchange between viruses and cellular organisms of their host superkingdoms and viral origins from host cells either via escape or reduction. However, viruses frequently establish non-lytic interactions with organisms and endogenize into the genomes of bacterial endosymbionts that reside in eukaryotic cells. Such interactions create opportunities for genetic exchange between viruses and organisms of non-host superkingdoms. Here, we take an atypical approach to revisit virus-cell interactions by first identifying protein fold structures in the proteomes of archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses and second by tracing their spread in the proteomes of superkingdoms Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The exercise quantified protein structural homologies between viruses and organisms of their host and non-host superkingdoms and revealed likely candidates for virus-to-cell and cell-to-virus gene transfers. Unexpected lifestyle-driven genetic affiliations between bacterioviruses and Eukarya and eukaryoviruses and Bacteria were also predicted in addition to a large cohort of protein folds that were universally shared by viral and cellular proteomes and virus-specific protein folds not detected in cellular proteomes.

High dose glucocorticosteroids, are currently recommended as first-line treatment for grade II-IV aGVHD resulting in overall complete responses (CR) in 40%-50% of patients. No standard second-line regimen has been established. Different options have been reported, including anti-TNFα antibodies. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of 15 patients with steroid-refractory (SR) aGVHD treated with etanercept at our institution. Patients were transplanted for a hematological malignancy and received either a myeloablative or a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen. Prophylaxis of GVHD consisted of cyclosporin A and mycophenolic acid. RESULTS: Acute GVHD was diagnosed at a median of 61 days post-transplantation. All patients had grade III aGVHD of the gut. Second-line treatment with etanercept was started at a median of 13 days after initiation of first-line therapy. Overall response rate was 53%, with CR in 3 patients and PR in 5 patients. Median overall survival after initiation of treatment with etanercept was 66 days (range 5–267) for the entire group. Median overall survival was 99 days (range 47–267 days) for responders and 17 days (range 5–66 days) for non-responders (p<0.01). Nevertheless, all patients died.

Ward-based i.e. point of care (POC) testing providing rapid results may alter the clinical management pathway. METHODS: FilmArray® RP polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems were placed in three in-patient and out-patient medical areas. Patients presenting with influenza-like illness /upper respiratory tract infection +/− lower RTI were recruited between January–July 2015. FilmArray® POC testing occurred on even days of the month (intervention) or routine, laboratory-based RP PCR testing +/− atypical serology on odd days (control). The primary outcome was length of hospital stay. The secondary outcomes were impact on the use of antimicrobials, readmissions, all-cause mortality, length of ward stay and turn-around time (TAT) (time to result from admission). RESULTS: Of 606 eligible patients, 545 (89.9%) were included; 211 in the control arm and 334 in the intervention arm. 20% of control arm patients and 24% of intervention arm patients had an RP detected. POC testing was not associated with the primary outcome measure, length of stay, but reduced the TAT from 39.5 h to 19.0 h, p < 0.001. Only the prescribing decision differed between study arms, p < 0.001. When antivirals were given, the intervention was associated with a reduction in the median time to the first dose of 36 h and allowed appropriate treatment of mycoplasma infection. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between respiratory PCR POC testing and length of stay or most of the secondary outcomes except the antimicrobial prescribing decision. This was probably due to a delay in initiating FilmArray® testing. Despite this, POC testing allowed time-critical antivirals to be given significantly faster, appropriate mycoplasma treatment and results were available considerably faster than routine, laboratory-based testing. Ward-staff of all grades performed POC testing without difficulty suggesting potential use across many divergent healthcare settings. Further studies evaluating the implementation of rapid respiratory PCR POC testing and the effect on length of stay and antimicrobial use are required.

Mutations in the viral spike (S) gene have been associated with FCoVs found in tissues from cats with FIP, but not FCoVs found in faeces from healthy cats, and are implicated in monocyte/macrophage tropism and systemic spread. This study was designed to determine whether S gene mutation analysis can reliably diagnose FIP. Cats were categorised as with FIP (n = 57) or without FIP (n = 45) based on gross post-mortem and histopathological examination including immunohistochemistry for FCoV antigen. RNA was purified from available tissue, fluid and faeces. Reverse-transcriptase quantitative-PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on all samples using FCoV-specific primers, followed by sequencing of a section of the S gene on RT-qPCR positive samples. Samples were available from a total of 102 cats. Tissue, fluid, and faecal samples from cats with FIP were more likely to be FCoV RT-qPCR-positive (90.4, 78.4 and 64.6% respectively) than those from cats without FIP (7.8, 2.1 and 20% respectively). Identification of S gene mutated FCoVs as an additional step to the detection of FCoV alone, only moderately increased specificity for tissue samples (from 92.6 to 94.6%) but specificity was unchanged for fluid samples (97.9%) for FIP diagnosis; however, sensitivity was markedly decreased for tissue (from 89.8 to 80.9%) and fluid samples (from 78.4 to 60%) for FIP diagnosis. These findings demonstrate that S gene mutation analysis in FCoVs does not substantially improve the ability to diagnose FIP as compared to detection of FCoV alone.

R(0) for severe acute respiratory syndrome is generally considered to be >1, whereas that for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is considered to be <1. However, this does not explain the large-scale outbreaks of MERS that occurred in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and South Korean hospitals. Aim: To estimate R(0) in nosocomial outbreaks of MERS. METHODS: R(0) was estimated using the incidence decay with an exponential adjustment model. The KSA and Korean outbreaks were compared using a line listing of MERS cases compiled using publicly available sources. Serial intervals to estimate R(0) were assumed to be six to eight days. Study parameters [R(0) and countermeasures (d)] were estimated by fitting a model to the cumulative incidence epidemic curves using Matlab. FINDINGS: The estimated R(0) in Korea was 3.9 in the best-fit model, with a serial interval of six days. The first outbreak cluster in a hospital in Pyeongtaek had an R(0) of 4.04, and the largest outbreak cluster in a hospital in Samsung had an R(0) of 5.0. Assuming a six-day serial interval, the KSA outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh had R(0) values of 3.9 and 1.9, respectively.

PDCoV has spread to many countries around the world, leading to significant economic losses in the pork industry. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive method for detection of PDCoV in clinical samples is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a single-tube one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay specific for nucleocapsid gene to diagnose and monitor PDCoV infections. The detection limit of RT-LAMP assay was 1 × 10(1) copies of PDCoV, which was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than gel-based one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This assay could specifically amplify PDCoV and had no cross amplification with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), porcine astrovirus (PAstV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classic swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). By screening a panel of clinical specimens (N = 192), this method presented a similar sensitivity with nested RT-PCR and was 1–2 log more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR in detection of PDCoV. CONCLUSIONS: The RT-LAMP assay established in this study is a potentially valuable tool, especially in low-resource laboratories and filed settings, for a rapid diagnosis, surveillance, and molecular epidemiology investigation of PDCoV infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for detection of newly emerged PDCoV with LAMP technology.

In a Swiss pig herd (n = 2 boars, 7 sows, 2 gilts, 18 finishing pigs, 30 fattening pigs, 54 suckling piglets), an outbreak of PCMV infection with high morbidity in all age categories, characterized by fever, anorexia, reduced general condition, respiratory signs and increased piglet mortality, was diagnosed by histopathology and molecular methods. Five fattening pigs (age ~ 17 weeks) additionally showed diarrhoea, not typical for PCMV infections, and one fattener had to be euthanized due to poor condition. Histopathologically, severe fibrinopurulent jejunoileitis with extensive atrophy and fusion of intestinal villi, loss of goblet cells and crypt abscesses associated to C. suis infection were present. In the liver, herpesvirus intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed and PCMV was confirmed by PCR/sequencing. No further infectious causes of diarrhoea (i.e. Rotavirus A; TGEV; PEDV; PCV-2; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli or Lawsonia intracellularis) were detected in the euthanized fattener. Coproscopically, C. suis oocysts were identified in the faeces from further fatteners with diarrhoea. While C. suis usually produces disease only in suckling piglets, its association with severe intestinal lesions and diarrhoea in ~ 17-week-old fatteners was surprising.

Influenzanet is a participatory surveillance system monitoring the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Europe since 2003. It is based on data provided by volunteers who self-report their symptoms via the Internet throughout the influenza season and currently involves 10 countries. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe the Influenzanet system and provide an overview of results from several analyses that have been performed with the collected data, which include participant representativeness analyses, data validation (comparing ILI incidence rates between Influenzanet and sentinel medical practice networks), identification of ILI risk factors, and influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies previously published. Additionally, we present new VE analyses for the Netherlands, stratified by age and chronic illness and offer suggestions for further work and considerations on the continuity and sustainability of the participatory system. METHODS: Influenzanet comprises country-specific websites where residents can register to become volunteers to support influenza surveillance and have access to influenza-related information. Participants are recruited through different communication channels. Following registration, volunteers submit an intake questionnaire with their postal code and sociodemographic and medical characteristics, after which they are invited to report their symptoms via a weekly electronic newsletter reminder. Several thousands of participants have been engaged yearly in Influenzanet, with over 36,000 volunteers in the 2015-16 season alone. RESULTS: In summary, for some traits and in some countries (eg, influenza vaccination rates in the Netherlands), Influenzanet participants were representative of the general population. However, for other traits, they were not (eg, participants underrepresent the youngest and oldest age groups in 7 countries). The incidence of ILI in Influenzanet was found to be closely correlated although quantitatively higher than that obtained by the sentinel medical practice networks. Various risk factors for acquiring an ILI infection were identified. The VE studies performed with Influenzanet data suggest that this surveillance system could develop into a complementary tool to measure the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, eventually in real time. CONCLUSIONS: Results from these analyses illustrate that Influenzanet has developed into a fast and flexible monitoring system that can complement the traditional influenza surveillance performed by sentinel medical practices. The uniformity of Influenzanet allows for direct comparison of ILI rates between countries. It also has the important advantage of yielding individual data, which can be used to identify risk factors. The way in which the Influenzanet system is constructed allows the collection of data that could be extended beyond those of ILI cases to monitor pandemic influenza and other common or emerging diseases.",2017-09-19,"Koppeschaar,CarlE;Colizza,Vittoria;Guerrisi,Caroline;Turbelin,Clément;Duggan,Jim;Edmunds,WJohn;Kjelsø,Charlotte;Mexia,Ricardo;Moreno,Yamir;Meloni,Sandro;Paolotti,Daniela;Perrotta,Daniela;vanStraten,Edward;Franco,AnaO",JMIRPublicHealthSurveill,3809016,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.7429;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28928112/,1o4d3emn,

Viral cell tropism is a key determinant of viral pathogenesis, but the tropism of RV is currently poorly understood. We analyzed various human cell lines and determined that RV only establishes an infection efficiently in particular non-immune cell lines. To establish an infection the host cells must be susceptible and permissible. To assess the susceptibility of individual cell lines, we generated a pseudotype vesicular stomatitis virus bearing RV envelope proteins (VSV-RV/CE2E1). VSV-RV/CE2E1 entered cells in an RV envelope protein-dependent manner, and thus the infection was neutralized completely by an RV-specific antibody. The infection was Ca(2+)-dependent and inhibited by endosomal acidification inhibitors, further confirming the dependency on RV envelope proteins for the VSV-RV/CE2E1 infection. Human non-immune cell lines were mostly susceptible to VSV-RV/CE2E1, while immune cell lines were much less susceptible than non-immune cell lines. However, susceptibility of immune cells to VSV-RV/CE2E1 was increased upon stimulation of these cells.

Although cholesterol is known to affect the replication of a broad range of viruses in vitro, its significance and role in porcine nidovirus infection remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether cellular or/and viral cholesterol levels play a role in porcine nidovirus infection. Our results showed that depletion of cellular cholesterol by treating cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) dose-dependently suppressed the replication of both nidoviruses. Conversely, cholesterol depletion from the viral envelope had no inhibitory effect on porcine nidovirus production. The addition of exogenous cholesterol to MβCD-treated cells moderately restored the infectivity of porcine nidoviruses, indicating that the presence of cholesterol in the target cell membrane is critical for viral replication. The antiviral activity of MβCD on porcine nidovirus infection was found to be predominantly exerted when used as a treatment pre-infection or prior to the viral entry process. Furthermore, pharmacological sequestration of cellular cholesterol efficiently blocked both virus attachment and internalization and, accordingly, markedly affected subsequent post-entry steps of the replication cycle, including viral RNA and protein biosynthesis and progeny virus production. Taken together, our data indicate that cell membrane cholesterol is required for porcine nidovirus entry into cells, and pharmacological drugs that hamper cholesterol-dependent virus entry may have antiviral potential against porcine nidoviruses.",2017-09-07,"Jeon,JiHyun;Lee,Changhee",ArchVirol,11658115,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884395/;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3545-4,0d6w8xyd,

Despite their minor proportion in the microbiome composition, these bacteria can significantly affect both the intestinal microbiota and the entire body thanks to a wide range of secreted compounds. Recently, insufficiency and limitations of pure genome-based analysis of gut microbiota became known. Thus, the need for intense functional studies is evident. This review aims to characterize the Bacillus and Lactobacillus in GIT, as well as the functional roles of the components released by these members of microbial intestinal community.

Yet, selection pressures driving DENV microevolution within human hosts (‘intrahost’) remain unknown. We employed a whole-genome segmented amplification approach coupled with deep sequencing to profile DENV-3 intrahost diversity in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and plasma samples from 77 dengue patients. DENV-3 intrahost diversity appears to be driven by immune pressures as well as replicative success in PBMCs and potentially other replication sites. Hotspots for intrahost variation were detected in 59–78% of patients in the viral Envelope and pre-Membrane/Membrane proteins, which together form the virion surface. Dominant variants at the hotspots arose via convergent microevolution, appear to be immune-escape variants, and were evolutionarily constrained at the macro-level due to viral replication defects.

Increasing numbers of studies are examining the occupational risk to healthcare workers due to proximity to patients. Selecting the appropriate air sampling method is a critical factor in assuring the analytical performance characteristics of a clinical study. The objective of this study was to compare the physical collection efficiency and virus collection efficiency of a 5 mL compact SKC BioSampler(®), a gelatin filter, and a glass fiber filter, in a laboratory setting. The gelatin filter and the glass fiber filter were housed in a home-made filter holder. Submersion (with vortexing and subsequent centrifugation) was used for the gelatin and glass fiber filters. Swabbing method was also tested to retrieve the viruses from the glass fiber filter. Experiments were conducted using the H1N1 influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (IAV-PR8), and viral recovery was determined using culture and commercial real-time-PCR (BioFire and Xpert). An atomizer was used to aerosolize a solution of influenza virus in PBS for measurement, and two Scanning Mobility Particle Sizers were used to determine particle size distributions. The SKC BioSampler demonstrated a U-shaped physical collection efficiency, lowest for particles around 30–50 nm, and highest at 10 nm and 300–350 nm within the size range examined. The physical collection efficiency of the gelatin filter was strongly influenced by air flow and time: a stable collection across all particle sizes was only observed at 2 L/min for the 9 min sampling time, otherwise, degradation of the filter was observed. The glass fiber filter demonstrated the highest physical collection efficiency (100% for all sizes) of all tested samplers, however, its overall virus recovery efficiency fared the worst (too low to quantify). The highest viral collection efficiencies for the SKC BioSampler and gelatin filter were 5% and 1.5%, respectively. Overall, the SKC BioSampler outperformed the filters.

Various porcine pathogens target macrophages, which are classical innate immune cells. Although macrophages basically protect the host from pathogens, they also seem to contribute to infectious processes. Therefore, cultured macrophages can be used to develop in vitro models for studying not only genes associated with porcine innate immunity but also the infectious processes of porcine pathogens. However, the availability of porcine macrophage cell lines is limited. In this study, we describe a novel immortalized porcine kidney-derived macrophage (IPKM) cell line, which was generated by transferring the SV40 large T antigen (SV40LT) and porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase (pTERT) genes into primary porcine kidney-derived macrophages using lentiviral vectors. The IPKM displayed a typical macrophage morphology and was routinely passaged (doubling time: about 4 days). These cells were immunostained for macrophage markers. In addition, they exhibited substantial phagocytosis of polystyrene microbeads and released inflammatory cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Furthermore, the maturation and secretion of interleukin-1β were observed after nigericin-induced inflammasome activation in LPS-primed IPKM. These findings suggest that IPKM exhibit the typical inflammatory characteristics of macrophages. By transferring the SV40LT and pTERT genes using lentiviral vectors, we also successfully immortalized macrophages derived from the peripheral blood of a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient pig. These results suggest that the co-expression of SV40LT and pTERT is an effective way of immortalizing porcine macrophages.",2017-08-21,"Takenouchi,Takato;Kitani,Hiroshi;Suzuki,Shunichi;Nakai,Michiko;Fuchimoto,Dai-ichiro;Tsukimoto,Mitsutoshi;Shinkai,Hiroki;Sato,Mitsuru;Uenishi,Hirohide",FrontVetSci,2150564,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2017.00132;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28871285/,0cqtxqjv,

The aim of this study was to examine the presence and significance of bacteria and viruses in the upper respiratory tract of healthcare workers (HCWs), and association with respiratory symptoms. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in China and 223 HCWs were recruited from fever clinics and respiratory, paediatric, emergency/Intensive medication wards. Participants were followed over 4 weeks (7th May 2015 to 4th June 2015) for development of clinical respiratory illness (CRI). Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study. The primary endpoints were laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation and viral respiratory infection. Rates of the following infections in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants were compared at the start or end of the study; 1) all bacterial/viral infections, 2) bacterial infection and bacterial-viral co-infections, excluding virus only infections, and 3) only bacterial infections. RESULTS: Bacterial colonisation was identified in 88% (196/223) of participants at the start or end of the study. Among these participants, 66% (148/223) had only bacterial colonisation while 22% (48/223) had co-infection with a virus. Bacteria were isolated from 170 (76.2%) participants at baseline and 127 (57%) participants at the end of the study. Laboratory confirmed viral infections were identified in 53 (23.8%) participants - 35 (15.7%) at the baseline and 20 (9.0%) at the end of the study. CRI symptoms were recorded in 12 participants (4.5%) and all had a positive bacterium isolation at baseline (n = 11) or end of the study (n = 1). Among asymptomatic participants, 187 (87%) had bacterial colonisation or bacterial/viral co-infection at baseline or end of the study. Viruses were also isolated from 5 (2.4%) asymptomatic cases. Rates of all infection outcomes were higher in symptomatic participants, however differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: We isolated high rates of bacteria and viruses in the upper respiratory tract of hospital HCWs, which may reflect greater exposure to respiratory infections in the hospital. Although respiratory infections are mostly symptomatic, the association between bacterial colonization and symptomatic illness is not clear. In the healthcare setting, HCWs may acquire and transmit infection to patients and other HCWs around them.

Then, the functional enrichment analysis of time-series genes in each group was performed using DAVID, and the genes enriched in the top ten functional categories were extracted to detect their expression patterns. Different time-series genes were identified in the three groups, and most of them were enriched in the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Time-series genes in the three treatment groups had different expression patterns and functions. Time-series genes in the ATO group (e.g. CCNA2 and DAB2) were significantly associated with cell adhesion, those in the AMN107 group were related to cellular carbohydrate metabolic process, while those in the ATO+AMN107 group (e.g. AP2M1) were significantly related to cell proliferation and antigen processing.

In 2009, it translated its contingency plan to respond to the unfolding influenza pandemic. However, little is known of how Malawi translated its national influenza plan into response actions, or the success of these responses. Objective: To investigate how Malawi translated its preparedness plan and so broaden our understanding of the outcomes of the responses. Methods: We draw on data from 22 in-depth interviews with government policymakers and people working at a policy level in various non-governmental organisations, conducted to assess the level of preparedness and the challenges of translating this. Results: Through a number of public health initiatives, authorities developed communication strategies, strengthened influenza surveillance activities and updated overall goals in pandemic training and education. However, without influenza drills, exercises and simulations to test the plan, activating the pandemic plan, including coordinating and deploying generic infection control measures, was problematic. Responses during the pandemic were at times ‘weak and clumsy’ and failed to mirror the activities and processes highlighted in the preparedness plan. Conclusions: Participants stressed that in order to achieve a coordinated and successful response to mitigate and prevent the further transmission of pandemic influenza, good preparation was critical. The key elements which they identified as relevant for a rapid response included effective communications, robust evidence-based decision-making, strong and reliable surveillance systems and flexible public health responses.

The clinical and microbiological nature of these exacerbations, the symptomatic triggers to take antibiotics, and the response to treatment have not been previously investigated. OBJECTIVES: To describe the nature, frequency, treatment, and clinical course of respiratory tract exacerbations in patients with CVID and to describe pathogens isolated during respiratory tract exacerbations. METHODS: We performed a prospective diary card exercise in 69 patients with CVID recruited from a primary immunodeficiency clinic in the United Kingdom, generating 6210 days of symptom data. We collected microbiology (sputum microscopy and culture, atypical bacterial PCR, and mycobacterial culture) and virology (nasopharyngeal swab multiplex PCR) samples from symptomatic patients with CVID. RESULTS: There were 170 symptomatic exacerbations and 76 exacerbations treated by antibiotics. The strongest symptomatic predictors for commencing antibiotics were cough, shortness of breath, and purulent sputum. There was a median delay of 5 days from the onset of symptoms to commencing antibiotics. Episodes characterized by purulent sputum responded more quickly to antibiotics, whereas sore throat and upper respiratory tract symptoms responded less quickly. A pathogenic virus was isolated in 56% of respiratory exacerbations and a potentially pathogenic bacteria in 33%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CVID delay and avoid treatment of symptomatic respiratory exacerbations, which could result in structural lung damage. However, viruses are commonly represented and illnesses dominated by upper respiratory tract symptoms respond poorly to antibiotics, suggesting that antibiotic usage could be better targeted.",2017-07-19,"Sperlich,JohannesM.;Grimbacher,Bodo;Workman,Sarita;Haque,Tanzina;Seneviratne,SuranjithL.;Burns,SiobhanO.;Reiser,Veronika;Vach,Werner;Hurst,JohnR.;Lowe,DavidM.",JAllergyClinImmunolPract,205665834,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28734862/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219817303872;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2017.05.024;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219817303872,1k8v0luz,

The HAV 3C cysteine protease (3Cpro), an important nonstructural protein, is responsible for most cleavage within the viral polyprotein and is critical for the processes of viral replication. Our group has previously demonstrated that HAV 3Cpro cleaves human NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), a kinase required in interferon signaling. Based on this finding, we generated four luciferase-based biosensors containing the NEMO sequence (PVLKAQ↓ADIYKA) that is cleaved by HAV 3Cpro and/or the Nostoc punctiforme DnaE intein, to monitor the activity of HAV 3Cpro in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T). Western blotting showed that HAV 3Cpro recognized and cleaved the NEMO cleavage sequence incorporated in the four biosensors, whereas only one cyclized luciferase-based biosensor (233-DnaE-HAV, 233DH) showed a measurable and reliable increase in firefly luciferase activity, with very low background, in the presence of HAV 3Cpro. With this biosensor (233DH), we monitored HAV 3Cpro activity in HEK-293T cells, and tested it against a catalytically deficient mutant HAV 3Cpro and other virus-encoded proteases. The results showed that the activity of this luciferase biosensor is specifically dependent on HAV 3Cpro.

We found that the NS1 C-terminal ED (named NS1/126-225) inhibits the active caspase activation and recruitment domain-containing form of RIG-I [RIG-I(N)]-induced IFN-β reporter activity, the phosphorylation of IRF3, and the induction of IFN-β. Further analysis showed that NS1/126-225 binds to TRAF3 through the TRAF domain, subsequently decreasing TRAF3 K63-linked ubiquitination. NS1/126-225 binding also disrupted the formation of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS)–TRAF3 complex, increasing the recruitment of IKKε to MAVS; ultimately shutting down the RIG-I(N)-mediated signal transduction and cellular antiviral responses.

Multiple promising targets have been identified that could lead to the development of potential therapies for ARDS; however, they have been limited because of difficulty with the mode of delivery, especially in critically ill patients. Nanobiotechnology is the basis of innovative techniques to deliver drugs targeted to the site of inflamed organs, such as the lungs. Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of agents, allowing an increase in the biodistribution of therapeutic agents to target organs and resulting in improved efficacy with reduction in drug toxicity.

The acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was used to determine abomasal emptying rate. Four healthy and five diarrheic female Holstein-Friesian calves (age < 14 days) were included in the study. For APAT, calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen/kg body weight, and blood samples were taken during a 12-h period afterward. Concomitantly, a WAC in the abomasum continuously measured luminal pH, pressure, and temperature. Five hours post suckling, intraluminal temperature was significantly higher in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves. Abomasal pH and pressure were not significantly different, but intraluminal pressure was always numerically lower in diarrheic calves. During APAT no significant differences in maximum acetaminophen concentrations (C(max)) and time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (T(max)) were observed.

The frequency and relevance of viral coinfections is still debatable. OBJECTIVE: Compare clinical presentation and severity between single virus infection and viral coinfection in children admitted for LRTI. METHODS: A 3-year period observational study (2012–2015) included children younger than two years admitted for LRTI. Viral identification was performed using PCR technique for 16 viruses. Clinical data and use of health resources was gathered during hospital stay using a standard collection form and we compared single virus infection and viral coinfections. RESULTS: The study included 524 samples (451 patients); 448 (85.5%) had at least one virus identified. Viral coinfections were found in 159 (35.5%). RSV and HRV were the most commonly identified virus; bronchiolitis and pneumonia the most frequent diagnosis. Patients with viral coinfections were older, attended day-care centers, had previous recurrent wheezing more frequently and were more symptomatic at admission. These patients did not have more complementary exams performed but were prescribed medications more often. Viral coinfection group did not show longer length of hospital stay and oxygen need, more need for ICU nor ventilatory support.

Although antibody secreting cells (ASC) within the inflamed CNS have been extensively examined, memory B cell (Bmem) characterization has been limited as they do not secrete antibody without stimulation. Moreover, unlike human Bmem, reliable surface markers for murine Bmem remain elusive. New method Using a viral encephalomyelitis model we developed a modified limiting dilution in vitro stimulation assay to convert CNS-derived virus specific Bmem into ASC. Comparison with existing methods Stimulation methods established for lymphoid tissue cells using prolonged stimulation with viral lysate resulted in substantial ASC loss and minimal Bmem to ASC conversion of CNS-derived cells. By varying stimulation duration, TLR activators, and culture supplements, we achieved optimal conversion by culturing cells with TLR7/8 agonist R848 in the presence of feeder cells for 2days. Results Flow cytometry markers CD38 and CD73 characterizing murine Bmem from lymphoid tissue showed more diverse expression patterns on corresponding CNS-derived B cell subsets. Using the optimized TLR7/8 stimulation protocol, we compared virus-specific IgG Bmem versus pre-existing ASC within the brain and spinal cord. Increasing Bmem frequencies during chronic infection mirrored kinetics of ASC. However, despite initially similar Bmem and ASC accumulation, Bmem prevailed in the brain, but were lower than ASC in the spinal cord during persistence.

GA inhibits promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes in a dose dependent manner at an IC50 value of 34 ± 3.0 μM and 20 ± 4.2 μM respectively. GA was non-toxic against THP-1 macrophage host cell line. GA was found to inhibit recombinant Leishmania donovani HMG-CoA reductase (LdHMGR) enzyme at the half-maximum inhibitory concentration of 24 ± 4.3 μM indicating the sensitivity and specificity of GA towards the enzyme. However, GA could cause only 30% reduction in HMGR activity when measured in Leishmania promastigotes treated with 34 μM of GA. Interestingly western blot analysis revealed fivefold reduced HMGR expression in GLA treated promastigotes. To further study the mode of action of GA, we used transgenic parasites overexpressing LdHMGR. Results indicated that ∼2 fold resistance was exhibited by LdHMGR overexpressing promastigotes to GA with an IC50 value of 74 μM compared to the wild type parasite. This explained the specific binding of GA to LdHMGR enzyme. There was ∼2 fold depletion in ergosterol levels in wild type promastigotes compared to the HMGR overexpressors. This data was further validated by exogenous supplementation of GA treated cells with ergosterol and 40% reversal of growth inhibition was observed.

The structure of the postfusion conformation of gB has been solved for several herpesviruses; however, the gB prefusion crystal structure and the details of how the protein refolds from a prefusion to a postfusion form to mediate fusion have not been determined. Using structure-based mutagenesis, we previously reported that three mutations (I671A, H681A, and F683A) in the C-terminal arm of the gB ectodomain greatly reduced cell-cell fusion. This fusion deficit could be rescued by the addition of a hyperfusogenic mutation, suggesting that the gB triple mutant was not misfolded. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), we constructed two independent herpes simplex virus 1 mutant strains (gB 3A) carrying the three arm mutations. The gB 3A viruses have 200-fold smaller plaques than the wild-type virus and demonstrate remarkably delayed entry into cells. Single-step and multistep growth curves show that gB 3A viruses have delayed replication kinetics. Interestingly, incubation at 40°C promoted the entry of the gB 3A viruses. We propose that the gB 3A viruses’ entry deficit is due to a loss of interactions between residues in the gB C-terminal arm and the coiled-coil core of gB. The results suggest that the triple alanine mutation may destabilize the postfusion gB conformation and/or stabilize the prefusion gB conformation and that exposure to elevated temperatures can overcome the defect in gB 3A viruses.",2017-05-16,"Fan,Qing;Kopp,SarahJ.;Connolly,SarahA.;Longnecker,Richard",mBio,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5433099/,1v6nf28a,

Self-assembly presents a unique opportunity to synthesize materials with well-defined compositions and controlled physical arrangement of molecular building blocks. This review highlights strategies exploiting these capabilities to improve the understanding of how precisely-displayed cues interact with immune cells and tissues.

Here, through public data mining, episomal luciferase reporter assay and in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we identified an IFN-responsive enhancer located 35 kb upstream of IFITM3 gene promoter upregulating the IFN-induced expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 bound to the enhancer with the treatment of IFN and was indispensable for the enhancer activity. Furthermore, using chromosome conformation capture technique, we revealed that the IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes physically clustered together and constitutively looped to the distal enhancer through long-range interactions in both HEK293 and A549 cells, providing structural basis for coordinated regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 by the enhancer.

However, it is currently unknown whether the NHP orthologues of human TMPRSS2 cleave and activate FLUAV hemagglutinin and contribute to viral spread in respiratory tissue. Here, we cloned and functionally analyzed the macaque and marmoset orthologues of human TMPRSS2. In addition, we analyzed the macaque orthologues of human TMPRSS4 and HAT, which also belong to the TTSP family. We found that all NHP orthologues of human TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT cleave and activate HA upon directed expression and provide evidence that endogenous TMPRSS2 is expressed in the respiratory epithelium of rhesus macaques. Finally, we demonstrate that a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2 suppresses FLUAV spread in precision-cut lung slices of human, macaque and marmoset origin. These results indicate that FLUAV depends on serine protease activity for spread in diverse NHP and in humans.

A global platform to communicate and share the research on these diseases is needed to facilitate the translation of knowledge into effective approaches and tools for their elimination. Based on the “One health, One world” mission, a new, open-access journal, Infectious Diseases of Poverty (IDP), was launched by BioMed Central in partnership with the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases (NIPD), Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) on October 25, 2012. Its aim is to identify and assess research and information gaps that hinder progress towards new interventions for a particular public health problem in the developing world. From the inaugural IDP issue of October 25, 2012, a total of 256 manuscripts have been published over the following five years. Apart from a small number of editorials, opinions, commentaries and letters to the editor, the predominant types of publications are research articles (69.5%) and scoping reviews (21.5%). A total of 1 081 contributing authors divided between 323 affiliations across 68 countries, territories and regions produced these 256 publications. The journal is indexed in major international biomedical databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Embase. In 2015, it was assigned its first impact factor (4.11), which is now 2.13. During the past five years, IDP has received manuscripts from 90 countries, territories and regions across six continents with an annual acceptance rate of all contributions maintained at less than 40%. Content analysis shows that neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), followed by the “Big Three” (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) and infectious diseases in general comprise 88% of all publications. In addition, a series of 10 thematic issues, covering 118 publications in all, was published as separate parts of the first five volumes. These publications were cited 975 times, which equals an average of 8.3 times per publication.

Here, we report that miR-142-5p is localized to neurons and negatively regulates neuronal morphogenesis in porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis (PHE). This phenotype was mediated by miR-142-5p inhibition of an mRNA encoding unc-51-like-kinase1 (Ulk1), which controls axon outgrowth and dendrite formation. Modulating miR-142-5p activity by microRNA mimics or inhibitors induced neurodegeneration, including stunted axon elongation, unstable dendritic spine formation, and irregular swelling and disconnection in neurites. Relieving Ulk1 mRNA repression in primary cortical neurons by miR-142-5p antagomirs or replication-deficient adenoviruses encoding Ulk1 (Ad5-Ulk1), which improved rescue of nerve injury, restricted viral replication, and increased survival rate in mice underlying PHEV infection. In contrast, disrupting Ulk1 in RNAi-expressing neurons mostly led to significantly shortened axon elongation and/or an abnormally large number of branched dendrites. Taken together, we demonstrated that the abnormal neuronal morphogenesis underlying PHEV infection was mainly caused by functional mRNA repression of the miR-142-5p target Ulk1.

Although a viral aetiological agent is estimated to be involved in up to 80% of cases, the majority of these agents have never been specifically identified. Since 2009, diagnostic and surveillance efforts for influenza virus have been applied worldwide. However, insufficient epidemiological information is available for the many other respiratory viruses that can cause Acute respiratory infections. METHODS: This study evaluated the presence of 14 non-influenza respiratory viruses in 872 pharyngeal exudate samples using RT-qPCR. All samples met the operational definition of a probable case of an influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory infection and had a previous negative result for influenza by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The presence of at least one non-influenza virus was observed in 312 samples (35.8%). The most frequent viruses were rhinovirus (RV; 33.0%), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; 30.8%) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV; 10.6%). A total of 56 cases of co-infection (17.9%) caused by 2, 3, or 4 viruses were identified. Approximately 62.5% of all positive cases were in children under 9 years of age. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified 13 non-influenza respiratory viruses that could occur in any season of the year. This study provides evidence for the prevalence and seasonality of a wide range of respiratory viruses that circulate in Mexico and constitute a risk for the population.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey using random Global Positioning System (GPS) spatial sampling conducted from the 8 August 2015 to 6 September 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or more. METHOD: A 19-item questionnaire was developed to assess respondents’ preparedness information acquisition, communication plan, evacuation strategies, first-aid and disaster knowledge, financial resilience, and preparedness behaviors. In total, 1023 residents were interviewed at 516 GPS locations. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with preparedness behaviors, defined as having an evacuation kit in our study. RESULTS: Television remains the key information source, both before and during disaster, with young respondents also favoring social media and the internet and elder residents preferring television and radio. Many respondents did not have adequate first-aid knowledge and few showed correct responses to a typhoon warning signal. Only 39.4% had an evacuation kit. In logistic regression, correct responses to first aid questions and a typhoon warning signal were significantly associated with kit preparation (OR 2.023, 95% CI 1.233−3.318, p=0.005).

Our previous experiments demonstrated that ATMUV infection effectively triggered host innate immune response through MDA5 and TLR3-dependent signaling pathways. However, little information is available on the role of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in defending against ATMUV infection. In this study, we found that ATMUV infection induced robust expression of type I and type III interferon (IFNs) in duck tissues. Furthermore, we observed that expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) was significantly upregulated in DEF and DF-1 cells after infection with ATMUV. Similar results were obtained from in vivo studies using ATMUV-infected ducklings. Importantly, we showed that knockdown of endogenous IFITM1 or IFITM3 by specific shRNA markedly enhanced ATMUV replication in DF-1 cells. However, disruption of IFITM2 expression had no obvious effect on the ATMUV replication. In addition, overexpression of chicken or duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 in DF-1 cells impaired the replication of ATMUV. Taken together, these results reveal that induced expression of avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 in response to ATMUV infection can effectively restrict the virus replication, and suggest that increasing IFITM proteins in host may be a useful strategy for control of ATMUV infection.",2017-04-20,"Chen,Shilong;Wang,Long;Chen,Jieying;Zhang,Lanlan;Wang,Song;Goraya,MohsanU.;Chi,Xiaojuan;Na,Yang;Shao,Wenhan;Yang,Zhou;Zeng,Xiancheng;Chen,Shaoying;Chen,Ji-Long",FrontMicrobiol,2163767,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00672;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28473814/,0pjg25kn,

In addition to its well-known role of binding iron, lactoferrin carries many important biological functions, including the promotion of cell proliferation and differentiation, and as an anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-parasitic protein. These functions differ among lactoferrin homologs in mammals. Although considerable attention has been given to the many functions of lactoferrin, its primary nutritional contribution is presumed to be related to its iron-binding characteristics, whereas the role of glycosylation has been neglected. Given the critical role of glycan binding in many biological processes, the glycan moieties in lactoferrin are likely to contribute significantly to the biological roles of lactoferrin. Despite the high amino acid sequence homology in different lactoferrins (up to 99%), each exhibits a unique glycosylation pattern that may be responsible for heterogeneity of the biological properties of lactoferrins. An important task for the production of biotherapeutics and medical foods containing bioactive glycoproteins is the assessment of the contributions of individual glycans to the observed bioactivities.

The nasopharynx is also the niche for potentially pathogenic agents which are associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD), a serious and costly illness in feedlot cattle. We used 14 beef heifers from a closed and disease-free herd to assess the dynamics of the NP microbiota of cattle that are transported to a feedlot. Cattle were sampled prior to transport to the feedlot (day 0) and at days 2, 7, and 14. RESULTS: The structure of the NP microbiota changed significantly over the course of the study, with the largest shift occurring between day 0 (prior to transport) and day 2 (P < 0.001). Phylogenetic diversity and richness increased following feedlot placement (day 2; P < 0.05). The genera Pasteurella, Bacillus, and Proteus were enriched at day 0, Streptococcus and Acinetobacter at day 2, Bifidobacterium at day 7, and Mycoplasma at day 14. The functional potential of the NP microbiota was assessed using PICRUSt, revealing that replication and repair, as well as translation pathways, were more relatively abundant in day 14 samples. These differences were driven mostly by Mycoplasma. Although eight cattle were culture-positive for the BRD-associated bacterium Pasteurella multocida at one or more sampling times, none were culture-positive for Mannheimia haemolytica or Histophilus somni. CONCLUSIONS: This study investigated the effect that feedlot placement has on the NP microbiota of beef cattle over a 14-d period. Within two days of transport to the feedlot, the NP microbiota changed significantly, increasing in both phylogenetic diversity and richness. These results demonstrate that there is an abrupt shift in the NP microbiota of cattle after transportation to a feedlot. This may have importance for understanding why cattle are most susceptible to BRD after feedlot placement.

Many instances of in-flight transmission have been documented, but the relative influence of the many factors (see below) affecting in-flight transmission has not been quantified. Long-standing guidance by public health agencies is that the primary transmission risk associated with air travel for most respiratory infectious diseases is associated with sitting within two rows of an infectious passenger. The effect of proximity may be one of these factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the risk of infection within and beyond the 2-row rule given by public health guidance. METHODS: We searched the literature for reports of in-flight transmission of infection which included seat maps indicating where the infectious and infected passengers were seated. FINDINGS: There is a ∼ 6% risk to passengers seated within the 2-rows of infected individual(s) and there is ∼ 2% risk to passengers seated beyond 2-rows from the infectious individual. DISCUSSION: Contact tracing limited to passengers within 2-rows of the infectious individual(s) could fail to detect other cases of infections. This has important consequences for assessing the spread of infectious diseases.

The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of pertussis in infants less than 6 months of age in Sarlahi District, Nepal. METHODS: Nested within a population-based randomized controlled trial of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, infants were visited weekly from birth through 6 months to assess respiratory illness in the prior week. If any respiratory symptoms had occurred, a nasal swab was collected and tested with a multitarget pertussis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The prospective cohort study includes infants observed between May 2011 and August 2014.

A binding domain that mediates the attachment of the virus to its receptor has been identified in the S1 protein of prototype IBV strain M41. In this study, we identified this binding domain in a different strain, as well as the cellular proteins that interact with it. First, we expressed the S1(N) proteins (residues 19-270) of M41 and another isolate, SCZJ3, and compared the binding capacities of recombinant S1(N)-M41 and S1(N)-SCZJ3 to host tissues. Protein histochemistry showed that both S1(N)-M41 and S1(N)-SCZJ3 could bind to lung and kidney, and that recombinant S1(N)-SCZJ3 displayed a distinctive staining pattern in the proventriculus. Recombinant S1(N)-SCZJ3 was then employed to purify binding-associated proteins in lung, kidney, and proventriculus. Using an affinity chromatography assay, two common bands of about 60 kDa and 70 kDa were obtained from the total tissue proteins. These protein bands were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Finally, infection of chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells by SCZJ3 was found to be inhibited by anti-HSP70 but not anti-PDI polyclonal antibody.

Previous work from our laboratory suggested that vaccines based on in situ produced, non-infectious rotavirus-like particles (RVLPs) are efficient while being entirely safe. However, using either vaccine, active mucosal immunization cannot induce protective immunity in newborns due to their immature immune system. We therefore hypothesized that offspring from vaccinated dams are passively immunized either by transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy or by taking up antibodies from milk. Using a codon optimized polycistronic gene expression cassette packaged into herpesvirus particles, the simultaneous expression of the RV capsid genes led to the intracellular formation of RVLPs in various cell lines. Vaccinated dams developed a strong RV specific IgG antibody response determined in sera and milk of both mother and pups. Moreover, sera of naïve pups nursed by vaccinated dams also had RV specific antibodies suggesting a lactogenic transfer of antibodies.

Little is known about the relationship between EV-D68 virus and host cells. In this study, we assessed the effect of the host cell cycle on EV-D68 viral production, as well as the ability of EV-D68 to manipulate host cell cycle progression. The results suggest that synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase, promotes viral production, while synchronization in G2/M inhibits viral production. Both an early EV-D68 isolate and currently circulating strains of EV-D68 can manipulate the host cell cycle to arrest cells in the G0/G1 phase, thus providing favorable conditions for virus production. Cell cycle regulation by EV-D68 was associated with corresponding effects on the expression of cyclins and CDKs, which were observed at the level of the protein and/or mRNA. Furthermore, the viral non-structural protein 3D of EV-D68 prevents progression from G0/G1 to S. Interestingly, another member of the Picornaviridae family, EV-A71, differs from EV-D68 in that G0/G1 synchronization inhibits, rather than promotes, EV-A71 viral replication. However, these viruses are similar in that G2/M synchronization inhibits the production and activity of both viruses, which is suggestive of a common therapeutic target for both types of enterovirus.

However, it is unclear whether some virus families have a greater propensity to jump host species than others. If related viruses have an evolutionary history of co-divergence with their hosts there should be evidence of topological similarities between the virus and host phylogenetic trees, whereas host jumping generates incongruent tree topologies. By analyzing co-phylogenetic processes in 19 virus families and their eukaryotic hosts we provide a quantitative and comparative estimate of the relative frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species transmission among virus families. Notably, our analysis reveals that cross-species transmission is a near universal feature of the viruses analyzed here, with virus-host co-divergence occurring less frequently and always on a subset of viruses. Despite the overall high topological incongruence among virus and host phylogenies, the Hepadnaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, Papillomaviridae and Adenoviridae, all of which possess double-stranded DNA genomes, exhibited more frequent co-divergence than the other virus families studied here. At the other extreme, the virus and host trees for all the RNA viruses studied here, particularly the Rhabdoviridae and the Picornaviridae, displayed high levels of topological incongruence, indicative of frequent host switching. Overall, we show that cross-species transmission plays a major role in virus evolution, with all the virus families studied here having the potential to jump host species, and that increased sampling will likely reveal more instances of host jumping.",2017-02-08,"Geoghegan,JemmaL.;Duchêne,Sebastián;Holmes,EdwardC.",PLoSPathog,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319820/,1u44tdrj,

However, the contribution between peripheral and CNS activation remains unclear. During gliatropic coronavirus induced encephalomyelitis, accumulation of protective antibody secreting cells is preceded by infiltration of B cells with a naïve and early differentiation phenotype (Phares et al., 2014). Investigation of the temporal dynamics of B cell activation in draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and the CNS revealed that peak CNS infiltration of early activated, unswitched IgD(+) and IgM(+) B cells coincided with polyclonal activation in CLN. By contrast, isotype-switched IgG(+) B cells did not accumulate until peripheral germinal center formation. In the CNS, unswitched B cells were confined to the perivascular space and meninges, with only rare B cell clusters, while isotype-switched B cells localized to parenchymal areas. Although ectopic follicle formation was not observed, more differentiated B cell subsets within the CNS expressed the germinal center marker GL7, albeit at lower levels than CLN counterparts. During chronic infection, CNS IgD(int) and IgD(−) B cell subsets further displayed sustained markers of proliferation and CD4 T cell help, which were only transiently expressed in the CLN. A contribution of local CD4 T cell help to sustain B cell activation was supported by occasional B cells adjacent to T cells. The results suggest that accumulation of differentiated B cell subsets within the CNS is largely dictated by peripheral activation, but that local events contribute to their sustained activation independent of ectopic follicle formation.",2017-02-01,"DiSano,KristaD.;Stohlman,StephenA.;Bergmann,CorneliaC.","Brain,Behavior,andImmunity",3759429,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159116304317;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159116304317;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27658544/;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2016.09.022;http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5215090?pdf=render,27dvsa27,

In young pigs, the virus is highly pathogenic and the associated morbidity and mortality has a significant negative impact on the swine industry. We have applied the IDEA model to better understand the 2014 PEDV outbreak in Ontario, Canada. Using our simple, 2-parameter IDEA model, we have evaluated the early epidemic dynamics of PEDV on Ontario swine farms. RESULTS: We estimated the best-fit R(0) and control parameter (d) for the between farm transmission component of the outbreak by fitting the model to publically available cumulative incidence data. We used maximum likelihood to compare model fit estimates for different combinations of the R(0) and d parameters. Using our initial findings from the iterative fitting procedure, we projected the time course of the epidemic using only a subset of the early epidemic data. The IDEA model projections showed excellent agreement with the observed data based on a 7-day generation time estimate. The best-fit estimate for R(0) was 1.87 (95% CI: 1.52 – 2.34) and for the control parameter (d) was 0.059 (95% CI: 0.022 – 0.117). Using data from the first three generations of the outbreak, our iterative fitting procedure suggests that R(0) and d had stabilized sufficiently to project the time course of the outbreak with reasonable accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence and spread of PEDV represents an important agricultural emergency. The virus presents a significant ongoing threat to the Canadian swine industry.

In this study, the immunogenicity of a subunit vaccine based on the spike protein of PEDV, which was directly targeted to porcine dendritic cells (DCs) expressing Langerin, was assessed. The PEDV S antigen was delivered to the dendritic cells through a single-chain antibody specific to Langerin and the targeted cells were stimulated with cholera toxin adjuvant. This approach, known as “dendritic cell targeting,” greatly improved PEDV S antigen-specific T cell interferon-γ responses in the CD4(pos)CD8(pos) T cell compartment in pigs as early as 7 days upon transdermal administration. When the vaccine protein was targeted to Langerin(pos) DCs systemically through intramuscular vaccination, it induced higher serum IgG and IgA responses in pigs, though these responses require a booster dose, and the magnitude of T cell responses were lower as compared to transdermal vaccination. We conclude that PEDV spike protein domains targeting Langerin-expressing dendritic cells significantly increased CD4 T cell immune responses in pigs. The results indicate that the immunogenicity of protein subunit vaccines can be greatly enhanced by direct targeting of the vaccine antigens to desirable dendritic cell subsets in pigs.",2017-01-02,"Subramaniam,Sakthivel;Cao,Dianjun;Tian,Debin;Cao,QianM.;Overend,Christopher;Yugo,DanielleM.;Matzinger,ShannonR.;Rogers,AdamJ.;Heffron,C.Lynn;Catanzaro,Nicholas;Kenney,ScottP.;Opriessnig,Tanja;Huang,Yao-Wei;Labarque,Geoffrey;Wu,StephenQ.;Meng,Xiang-Jin",VirusRes,12708864,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27784629/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216304968;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.10.007;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216304968,0p93a2o2,

In veterinary medicine, zoonoses present a risk to practitioners, yet little is known about how these risks are understood and how this translates into health protective behaviour. This study aimed to explore risk perceptions within the British veterinary profession and identify motivators and barriers to compliance with IPCs. A cross-sectional study was conducted using veterinary practices registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. Here we demonstrate that compliance with IPCs is influenced by more than just knowledge and experience, and understanding of risk is complex and multifactorial. Out of 252 respondents, the majority were not concerned about the risk of zoonoses (57.5%); however, a considerable proportion (34.9%) was. Overall, 44.0% of respondents reported contracting a confirmed or suspected zoonoses, most frequently dermatophytosis (58.6%). In veterinary professionals who had previous experience of managing zoonotic cases, time or financial constraints and a concern for adverse animal reactions were not perceived as barriers to use of personal protective equipment (PPE). For those working in large animal practice, the most significant motivator for using PPE was concerns over liability. When assessing responses to a range of different “infection control attitudes”, veterinary nurses tended to have a more positive perspective, compared with veterinary surgeons. Our results demonstrate that IPCs are not always adhered to, and factors influencing motivators and barriers to compliance are not simply based on knowledge and experience. Educating veterinary professionals may help improve compliance to a certain extent, however increased knowledge does not necessarily equate to an increase in risk-mitigating behaviour. This highlights that the construction of risk is complex and circumstance-specific and to get a real grasp on compliance with IPCs, this construction needs to be explored in more depth.",2017-01-01,"Robin,Charlotte;Bettridge,Judy;McMaster,Fiona",PrevVetMed,207419256,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28010906/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587716306109;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587716306109;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.11.015,0tun7fjk,

PDCoV diarrhea was first reported in the US in early 2014, concurrently with co-circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus). The origin of PDCoV in pigs and also its sudden emergence or route of introduction into the US still remains unclear. In the US, since 2013–2014, the newly emerged PDCoV and PEDV have spread nationwide, causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic impacts. The current US PDCoV strains are enteropathogenic and infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. Similar to PEDV infections, PDCoV infections also cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by transient viremia (viral RNA) that leads to severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, followed by dehydration as the potential cause of death in nursing piglets. At present, differential diagnosis of PDCoV, PEDV, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is essential to control viral diarrheas in US swine.

Live attenuated vaccines historically have been the most efficient. We consider that the new trend is the development of recombinant vaccines by using reverse genetics systems to engineer attenuated viruses, which could be used as effective and safe modified live vaccine candidates. To this end, host cell signaling pathways influencing porcine CoV virulence should be identified. Similarly, the identity of viral proteins involved in the modulation of host cell pathways influencing CoV pathogenesis should be analyzed. With this information, and using reverse genetics systems, it is possible to design viruses with modifications in the viral proteins acting as virulence factors, which may lead to attenuated viruses and, therefore, vaccine candidates.

Different types of risk are associated with land acquisition conflict in different Chinese cities. In this study, two types of cities are discussed: those with a historically low level of development but recent rapid economic growth, such as Yueqing; and cities that have maintained a relatively high level of development and experienced stable growth, such as Jiaxing. Land acquisition conflict in these two representative cities is then analysed in terms of property rights, access to resources and development. Analysis is performed at the institutional level to provide more accurate insights into the dynamics of conflict. The findings of the study suggest that different risk-management strategies are used in the two kinds of city, and that conflict is more likely to occur in cities with historically weaker development, such as Yueqing.

METHODS: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1990 to December 31(st), 2015, with language restriction to English, Spanish, German and French. RESULTS: We identified three studies investigating accessibility of the location of the antiseptic hand rub dispenser. Each of them showed a significant improvement of hand hygiene compliance or agent consumption with the implementation of accessible dispensers near the patient bed. Nine eligible studies evaluated the impact of single-patient rooms on the acquisition of healthcare-associated colonization and infections in comparison to multi-bedrooms or an open ward design. Six of these studies showed a significant benefit of single-patient bedrooms in reducing the healthcare-associated colonization and infection rate, whereas three studies found that single-patient rooms are neither a protective nor risk factor. In meta-analyses, the overall risk ratio for acquisition of healthcare-associated colonization and infection was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.74), for healthcare-associated colonization 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.85) and for bacteremia 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.76), all in favor of patient care in single-patient bedrooms.

We thus aimed to understand the interaction of viral infections and the nasal microbiota in early life to appraise their roles in disease development. Thirty-two healthy, unselected infants were included in this prospective longitudinal cohort study within the first year of life. Biweekly nasal swabs (n = 559) were taken, and the microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing, and 10 different viruses and 2 atypical bacteria were characterized by real-time PCR (combination of seven duplex samples). In contrast to asymptomatic human rhinovirus (HRV) colonization, symptomatic HRV infections were associated with lower alpha diversity (Shannon diversity index [SDI]), higher bacterial density (PCR concentration), and a difference in beta diversities (Jaccard and Bray-Curtis index) of the microbiota. In addition, infants with more frequent HRV infections had a lower SDI at the end of the study period. Overall, changes in the microbiota associated with symptomatic HRV infections were characterized by a loss of microbial diversity. The interaction between HRV infections and the nasal microbiota in early life might be of importance for later disease development and indicate a potential approach for future interventions. IMPORTANCE Respiratory viral infections are very frequent in infancy and of importance in acute and chronic disease development. Infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) are, e.g., associated with the later development of asthma. We found that only symptomatic HRV infections were associated with acute changes in the nasal microbiota, mainly characterized by a loss of microbial diversity. Infants with more frequent symptomatic HRV infections had a lower bacterial diversity at the end of the first year of life. Whether the interaction between viruses and the microbiota is one pathway contributing to asthma development will be assessed in the follow-ups of these children.

Selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analysis of the secondary structure of the EBOV minigenomic RNA indicates formation of a small stem-loop composed of the HSPA8 motif, a 3′ stem-loop (nucleotides 1868–1890) that is similar to a previously identified structure in the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA and a panhandle domain involving a trailer-to-leader interaction. Results of minigenome assays and an EBOV reverse genetic system rescue support a role for both the panhandle domain and HSPA8 motif 1 in virus replication.",2016-11-16,"Sztuba-Solinska,Joanna;Diaz,Larissa;Kumar,MiaR.;Kolb,Gaëlle;Wiley,MichaelR.;Jozwick,Lucas;Kuhn,JensH.;Palacios,Gustavo;Radoshitzky,SheliR.;J.LeGrice,StuartF.;Johnson,ReedF.",NucleicAcidsRes,33313334,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27651462/,08tknscm,

METHODS: Seven thousands two hundreds eighty one participants from nine areas in Gyeonggi-do including Pyeongtaek, the origin of the outbreak in 2015 agreed to participate in the survey and the data from 6,739 participants were included in the final analysis. The data on the perceived infection sensitivity were subjected to cluster analysis. The levels of stress, reliability/practice of preventive behaviors, hand washing practice and policy credibility during the outbreak period were analyzed for each cluster. RESULTS: Cluster analysis of infection sensitivity due to the MERS outbreak resulted in classification of participants into four groups: the non-sensitive group (14.5%), social concern group (17.4%), neutral group (29.1%), and overall sensitive group (39.0%). A logistic regression analysis found that the overall sensitive group with high sensitivity had higher stress levels (17.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.77 to 23.00), higher reliability on preventive behaviors (5.81; 95% CI, 4.84 to 6.98), higher practice of preventive behaviors (4.53; 95% CI, 3.83 to 5.37) and higher practice of hand washing (2.71; 95% CI, 2.13 to 3.43) during the outbreak period, compared to the non-sensitive group. CONCLUSIONS: Infection sensitivity of community residents during the MERS outbreak correlated with gender, age, occupation, and health behaviors. When there is an outbreak in the community, there is need to maintain a certain level of sensitivity while reducing excessive stress, as well as promote the practice of preventive behaviors among local residents. In particular, target groups need to be notified and policies need to be established with a consideration of the socio-demographic characteristics of the community.",2016-11-16,"Lee,SoonYoung;Yang,HeeJeong;Kim,Gawon;Cheong,Hae-Kwan;Choi,BoYoul",EpidemiolHealth,39865014,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28092927/;https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2016051,1sn5i2c2,

As a result of ineffective initial control efforts, an Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scale emerged. As of 4 May 2015, it had resulted in more than 19,000 probable and confirmed Ebola cases, mainly in Guinea (3,529), Liberia (5,343), and Sierra Leone (10,746). Here, we present analyses of data collected during the outbreak identifying drivers of transmission and highlighting areas where control could be improved. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Over 19,000 confirmed and probable Ebola cases were reported in West Africa by 4 May 2015. Individuals with confirmed or probable Ebola (“cases”) were asked if they had exposure to other potential Ebola cases (“potential source contacts”) in a funeral or non-funeral context prior to becoming ill. We performed retrospective analyses of a case line-list, collated from national databases of case investigation forms that have been reported to WHO. These analyses were initially performed to assist WHO’s response during the epidemic, and have been updated for publication. We analysed data from 3,529 cases in Guinea, 5,343 in Liberia, and 10,746 in Sierra Leone; exposures were reported by 33% of cases. The proportion of cases reporting a funeral exposure decreased over time. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.35, p < 0.001) between this proportion in a given district for a given month and the within-district transmission intensity, quantified by the estimated reproduction number (R). We also found a negative correlation (r = −0.37, p < 0.001) between R and the district proportion of hospitalised cases admitted within ≤4 days of symptom onset. These two proportions were not correlated, suggesting that reduced funeral attendance and faster hospitalisation independently influenced local transmission intensity. We were able to identify 14% of potential source contacts as cases in the case line-list. Linking cases to the contacts who potentially infected them provided information on the transmission network. This revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in inferred transmissions, with only 20% of cases accounting for at least 73% of new infections, a phenomenon often called super-spreading. Multivariable regression models allowed us to identify predictors of being named as a potential source contact. These were similar for funeral and non-funeral contacts: severe symptoms, death, non-hospitalisation, older age, and travelling prior to symptom onset. Non-funeral exposures were strongly peaked around the death of the contact. There was evidence that hospitalisation reduced but did not eliminate onward exposures. We found that Ebola treatment units were better than other health care facilities at preventing exposure from hospitalised and deceased individuals. The principal limitation of our analysis is limited data quality, with cases not being entered into the database, cases not reporting exposures, or data being entered incorrectly (especially dates, and possible misclassifications). CONCLUSIONS: Achieving elimination of Ebola is challenging, partly because of super-spreading. Safe funeral practices and fast hospitalisation contributed to the containment of this Ebola epidemic. Continued real-time data capture, reporting, and analysis are vital to track transmission patterns, inform resource deployment, and thus hasten and maintain elimination of the virus from the human population.",2016-11-15,"Agua-Agum,Junerlyn;Ariyarajah,Archchun;Aylward,Bruce;Bawo,Luke;Bilivogui,Pepe;Blake,IsobelM.;Brennan,RichardJ.;Cawthorne,Amy;Cleary,Eilish;Clement,Peter;Conteh,Roland;Cori,Anne;Dafae,Foday;Dahl,Benjamin;Dangou,Jean-Marie;Diallo,Boubacar;Donnelly,ChristlA.;Dorigatti,Ilaria;Dye,Christopher;Eckmanns,Tim;Fallah,Mosoka;Ferguson,NeilM.;Fiebig,Lena;Fraser,Christophe;Garske,Tini;Gonzalez,Lice;Hamblion,Esther;Hamid,Nuha;Hersey,Sara;Hinsley,Wes;Jambei,Amara;Jombart,Thibaut;Kargbo,David;Keita,Sakoba;Kinzer,Michael;George,FredKuti;Godefroy,Beatrice;Gutierrez,Giovanna;Kannangarage,Niluka;Mills,HarrietL.;Moller,Thomas;Meijers,Sascha;Mohamed,Yasmine;Morgan,Oliver;Nedjati-Gilani,Gemma;Newton,Emily;Nouvellet,Pierre;Nyenswah,Tolbert;Perea,William;Perkins,Devin;Riley,Steven;Rodier,Guenael;Rondy,Marc;Sagrado,Maria;Savulescu,Camelia;Schafer,IlanaJ.;Schumacher,Dirk;Seyler,Thomas;Shah,Anita;VanKerkhove,MariaD.;Wesseh,C.Samford;Yoti,Zabulon",PLoSMed,4812716,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002170;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27846234/,069pelqj,

ANIMALS: Three‐hundred dogs attending 3 regional dog parks in Northern California. METHODS: Prospective study. Fresh fecal specimens were collected from all dogs, scored for consistency, and owners completed a questionnaire. Specimens were analyzed by fecal centrifugation flotation, DFA, and PCR for detection of 11 enteropathogens. Giardia genotyping was performed for assemblage determination. RESULTS: Enteropathogens were detected in 114/300 dogs (38%), of which 62 (54%) did not have diarrhea. Frequency of dog park attendance correlated significantly with fecal consistency (P = .0039), but did not correlate with enteropathogen detection. Twenty‐seven dogs (9%) were infected with Giardia, and genotyping revealed nonzoonotic assemblages C and D.

Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission. METHODS: We estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July–August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines. FINDINGS: We estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5·2 and 7·1. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%. INTERPRETATION: Dose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.",2016-11-10,"Wu,JosephT.;Peak,CoreyM.;Leung,GabrielM.;Lipsitch,Marc",Lancet,11528111,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31838-4;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27837923/,02pjdufw,

Grossly, there were patchy or diffuse areas of endocardial thickening affecting the left ventricle. The more common patchy endocardial lesions occurred as large trabecular or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum. Microscopically, regardless of the gross pattern, the thickened endocardium contained various numbers of stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells surrounded by fibrous connective tissue. Immunohistochemical findings were indicative of smooth muscle differentiation in mesenchymal cells. These cells proliferated vigorously and produced alcian blue-positive ground substance and collagen fibres; it was considered that the mesenchymal cells contributed to the formation of the endocardial lesions. In addition, multiple left ventricular ‘false tendons’ were invariably included within the trabecular or broad fibrous bands, providing a framework for formation of those bands. Evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis was lacking in all 41 cases, and no viral genomes were detected in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 of the hearts.

We have previously shown that local type I interferon response within the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in the protection of mice against tick-borne flavivirus infection. However, the cells responsible for mounting this protective response are not defined. METHODS: Primary astrocytes were isolated from wild-type (WT) and interferon alpha receptor knock out (IFNAR(−/−)) mice and infected with neurotropic flaviviruses. Viral replication and spread, IFN induction and response, and cellular viability were analyzed. Transcriptional levels in primary astrocytes treated with interferon or supernatant from virus-infected cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing and evaluated by different bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Here, we show that astrocytes control viral replication of different TBEV strains, JEV, WNV, and ZIKV. In contrast to fibroblast, astrocytes mount a rapid interferon response and restrict viral spread. Furthermore, basal expression levels of key interferon-stimulated genes are high in astrocytes compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-sequencing data reveals that astrocytes have established a basal antiviral state which contributes to the rapid viral recognition and upregulation of interferons. The most highly upregulated pathways in neighboring cells were linked to type I interferon response and innate immunity. The restriction in viral growth was dependent on interferon signaling, since loss of the interferon receptor, or its blockade in wild-type cells, resulted in high viral replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects. Astrocyte supernatant from TBEV-infected cells can restrict TBEV growth in astrocytes already 6 h post infection, the effect on neurons is highly reinforced, and astrocyte supernatant from 3 h post infection is already protective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the combination of an intrinsic constitutive antiviral response and the fast induction of type I IFN production by astrocytes play an important role in self-protection of astrocytes and suppression of flavivirus replication in the CNS.

However, its general application has been hampered by difficulty in identifying a specific ligand-responsive pseudoknot that also functions as a ligand-dependent -1 PRF stimulator. We addressed this problem by using the −1 PRF stimulation pseudoknot of SARS-CoV (SARS-PK) to build a ligand-dependent −1 PRF stimulator. In particular, the extra stem of SARS-PK was replaced by an RNA aptamer of theophylline and designed to couple theophylline binding with the stimulation of −1 PRF. Conformational and functional analyses indicate that the engineered theophylline-responsive RNA functions as a mammalian riboswitch with robust theophylline-dependent −1 PRF stimulation activity in a stable human 293T cell-line. Thus, RNA–ligand interaction repertoire provided by in vitro selection becomes accessible to ligand-specific −1 PRF stimulator engineering using SARS-PK as the scaffold for synthetic biology application.",2016-10-14,"Lin,Ya-Hui;Chang,Kung-Yao",NucleicAcidsRes,15631712,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27521370/,1pou702r,

Few data have been published on unselected populations. The main aim of this study was to analyse symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections during the first year of life in a cohort of infants, recruited at birth, and the development of recurrent wheezing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 302 newborns were recruited. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken when the patients had a respiratory infection, as well as in the visits for vaccination at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. RT-nested PCR assays were performed to detect 16 viruses. RESULTS: A total of 1,293 samples were analysed (1,005 healthy controls and 288 respiratory infections). Samples taken during routine check-ups were positive in 30.8% of cases, while those with respiratory infection were positive in 77.8%, P < .001 (OR: 3, 95% CI: 2.4-3.8). A total of 239 (79%) infants had at least 1 positive respiratory viral infection detected. The most frequent virus (71%) was rhinovirus (RV). Recurrent wheezing was found in 27 (11%) children during their first year of life (1.2 episodes, SD 2.9). Recurrent wheezing was present in 58.3% of patients admitted to hospital during their first viral infection, vs. 8.6% of infants when the first infection was mild or who had asymptomatic viral detection, P < .001 (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.05-4.5).

In this study, we established a high-throughput screening (HTS) system based on CHIKV 26S mediated insect cell fusion inhibition assay. Our screening system was able to search potential anti-CHIKV drugs in vitro. Using this system, four compounds (niclosamide, nitazoxanide, niflumic acid, tolfenamic acid) were identified. These compounds were then further analyzed using a microneutralization assay. We determined that niclosamide and nitazoxanide exhibit ability to against CHIKV-induced CPE. The anti-CHIKV abilities of these compounds were further confirmed by RT-qPCR and IFA.

These bacteria still are of great importance, but continuously increasing herd sizes have complicated the scenario and the influence of secondary invaders may have been increased. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of A. pleuropneumoniae and M. hyopneumoniae, as well as that of the secondary invaders Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis by serology in four pig herds (A–D) using age segregated rearing systems with high incidences of pleuritic lesions at slaughter. RESULTS: Pleuritic lesions registered at slaughter ranged from 20.5 to 33.1 % in the four herds. In herd A, the levels of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae exceeded A(450) > 1.5, but not to any other microbe searched for. The seroconversion took place early during the fattening period. Similar levels of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae were also recorded in herd B, with a subsequent increase in levels of antibodies to P. multocida. Pigs seroconverted to both agents during the early phase of the fattening period. In herd C, pigs seroconverted to P. multocida during the early phase of the fattening period and thereafter to A. pleuropneumoniae. In herd D, the levels of antibodies to P. multocida exceeded A(450) > 1.0 in absence (A(450) < 0.5) of antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae. The levels of serum antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae and to S. suis remained below A(450) < 1.0 in all four herds. Pigs seroconverted to M. hyopneumoniae late during the rearing period (herd B–D), or not at all (herd A). CONCLUSION: Different serological patterns were found in the four herds with high levels of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae and P. multocida, either alone or in combination with each other. Seroconversion to M. hyopneumoniae late during the rearing period or not at all, confirmed the positive effect of age segregated rearing in preventing or delaying infections with M. hyopneumoniae.

Bat coronavirus (BatCoV) HKU9 is an important betacoronavirus (betaCoV) that is phylogenetically affiliated with the same genus as MERS-CoV. The bat surveillance data indicated that BatCoV HKU9 has been widely spreading and circulating in bats. This highlights the necessity of characterizing the virus for its potential to cross species barriers. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus spike (S) protein recognizes host receptors to mediate virus entry and is therefore a key factor determining the viral tropism and transmission capacity. In this study, the putative S RBD of BatCoV HKU9 (HKU9-RBD), which is homologous to other betaCoV RBDs that have been structurally and functionally defined, was characterized via a series of biophysical and crystallographic methods. By using surface plasmon resonance, we demonstrated that HKU9-RBD binds to neither SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 nor MERS-CoV receptor CD26. We further determined the atomic structure of HKU9-RBD, which as expected is composed of a core and an external subdomain. The core subdomain fold resembles those of other betaCoV RBDs, whereas the external subdomain is structurally unique with a single helix, explaining the inability of HKU9-RBD to react with either ACE2 or CD26. Via comparison of the available RBD structures, we further proposed a homologous intersubdomain binding mode in betaCoV RBDs that anchors the external subdomain to the core subdomain. The revealed RBD features would shed light on the evolution route of betaCoV.",2016-10-03,"Huang,Canping;Qi,Jianxun;Lu,Guangwen;Wang,Qihui;Yuan,Yuan;Wu,Ying;Zhang,Yanfang;Yan,Jinghua;Gao,GeorgeF.",Biochemistry,25155967,True,custom_license,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00790;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27696819/,0y0hau9l,

Here, we report the construction of a plasmid carrying a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-expressed prototype 1947 Uganda MR766 ZIKV cDNA that can initiate infection following direct plasmid DNA transfection of mammalian cells. Incorporation of a synthetic intron in the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) region of the ZIKV polyprotein reduced viral cDNA-associated toxicity in bacteria. High levels of infectious virus were produced following transfection of the plasmid bearing the wild-type MR766 ZIKV genome, but not one with a disruption to the viral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) polymerase active site. Multicycle growth curve and plaque assay experiments indicated that the MR766 virus resulting from plasmid transfection exhibited growth characteristics that were more similar to its parental isolate than previously published 2010 Cambodia and 2015 Brazil cDNA-rescued ZIKV. This ZIKV infectious clone will be useful for investigating the genetic determinants of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis and should be amenable to construction of diverse infectious clones expressing reporter proteins and representing a range of ZIKV isolates.

METHODS: A panel of 18 clinicians from the Infectious Diseases Working Party of the German Society for Haematology and Medical Oncology have convened to assess the available literature and provide recommendations on the management of CRV infections including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. RESULTS: CRV infections in cancer patients may lead to pneumonia in approximately 30% of the cases, with an associated mortality of around 25%. For diagnosis of a CRV infection, combined nasal/throat swabs or washes/aspirates give the best results and nucleic acid amplification based-techniques (NAT) should be used to detect the pathogen. Hand hygiene, contact isolation and face masks have been shown to be of benefit as general infection management. Causal treatment can be given for influenza, using a neuraminidase inhibitor, and respiratory syncytial virus, using ribavirin in addition to intravenous immunoglobulins. Ribavirin has also been used to treat parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus, but data are inconclusive in this setting. Cidofovir is used to treat adenovirus pneumonitis.

The aim of the study was to estimate in population of free-living wild boar in the Czech Republic the prevalence of enteric viral pathogens, namely rotavirus groups A and C (RVA and RVC), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and members of family Coronaviridae (transmissible gastroenteritis virus – TGEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus − PEDV, porcine respiratory coronavirus – PRCV, and porcine hemagglutination encephalomyelitis virus – PHEV) and Picornaviridae,(teschovirus A – PTV, sapelovirus A – PSV, and enterovirus G – EV-G). In our study, stool samples from 203 wild boars culled during hunting season 2014–2015 (from October to January) were examined by RT-PCR. RVA was detected in 2.5% of tested samples. Nucleotide analysis of VP7, VP4, and VP6 genes revealed that four RVA strains belong to G4P[25]I1, G4P[6]I5, G11P[13]I5, and G5P[13]I5 genotypes and phylogenetic analysis suggested close relation to porcine and human RVAs. The prevalence of RVC in wild boar population reached 12.8%, PTV was detected in 20.2%, PSV in 8.9%, and EV-G in 2.5% of samples. During our study no PRRSV or coronaviruses were detected.

METHODS: The epidemiology of respiratory viruses among healthy children (6 months to <10 years) with influenza-like illness (ILI) was determined in a population sample derived from an influenza vaccine trial (NCT01051661) in 17 centers in eight countries (Australia, South East Asia and Latin America). Active surveillance for ILI was conducted for approximately 1 year (between February 2010 and August 2011), with PCR analysis of nasal and throat swabs. RESULTS: 6266 children were included, of whom 2421 experienced 3717 ILI episodes. Rhinovirus/enterovirus had the highest prevalence (41.5%), followed by influenza (15.8%), adenovirus (9.8%), parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (both 9.7%), coronavirus (5.6%), human metapneumovirus (5.5%) and human bocavirus (HBov) (2.0%).

Pulmonary delivery is a promising approach of delivering RNAi therapeutics directly to the airways for treating local conditions and minimizing systemic side effects. It is a non-invasive route of administration that is generally well accepted by patients. However, pulmonary drug delivery is a challenge as the lungs pose a series of anatomical, physiological and immunological barriers to drug delivery. Understanding these barriers is essential for the development an effective RNA delivery system. In this review, the different barriers to pulmonary drug delivery are introduced.

One facet of this is frameshifting that often results in synthesis of a C-terminal region encoded by a new frame. Ribosomal frameshifting is utilized for the synthesis of additional products, for regulatory purposes and for translational ‘correction’ of problem or ‘savior’ indels. Utilization for synthesis of additional products occurs prominently in the decoding of mobile chromosomal element and viral genomes. One class of regulatory frameshifting of stable chromosomal genes governs cellular polyamine levels from yeasts to humans. In many cases of productively utilized frameshifting, the proportion of ribosomes that frameshift at a shift-prone site is enhanced by specific nascent peptide or mRNA context features. Such mRNA signals, which can be 5′ or 3′ of the shift site or both, can act by pairing with ribosomal RNA or as stem loops or pseudoknots even with one component being 4 kb 3′ from the shift site. Transcriptional realignment at slippage-prone sequences also generates productively utilized products encoded trans-frame with respect to the genomic sequence. This too can be enhanced by nucleic acid structure.

Swift identification and implementation of transmission based precautions (TBP) for patients known or suspected of having an epidemiologically important pathogen is important. ED staff, particularly triage nurses, are pivotal in detecting and preventing infection, including healthcare associated infections (HAI). Methods MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and Ovid were searched for articles published between 2004 and 2015 using key search terms: infection control/prevention and emergency department(s), triage, and transmission based precautions and emergency department(s), and triage, to identify common themes for discussion. Systematic review/meta-analysis was not in the scope of this exploration. Findings Themes were identified relating to HAI and ED practices and grouped into: assisted detection of conditions for which TBP is required, ED and TBP, mass-causality event/bioterrorism/pandemic/epidemic, infection control not TBP and multi-resistant organisms not TBP. The literature is heavily influenced by worldwide epidemic/pandemics and bioterrorist risks resulting in increased awareness of the importance of swift identification of syndromes that require TBP, but only in these situations.

Many cases are often misclassified and underdiagnosed. We conducted a retrospective study on infants to assess how often physicians suspected pertussis and the actual frequency of Bordetella pertussis infections. METHODS: We analyzed all infants with age ≤90 days hospitalized from March 2011 until September 2013 for acute respiratory symptoms tested with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction able to detect Bordetella pertussis and with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction for a multipanel respiratory virus. Therefore, we compared patients with pertussis positive aspirate, patients with respiratory virus positive aspirate and patients with negative aspirate to identify symptoms or clinical findings predictive of pertussis. RESULTS: Out of 215 patients analyzed, 53 were positive for pertussis (24.7 %), 119 were positive for respiratory virus (55.3 %) and 43 had a negative aspirate (20 %). Pertussis was suspected in 22 patients at admission and 16 of them were confirmed by laboratory tests, while 37 infants with different admission diagnosis resulted positive for pertussis. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis was 30.2 % and the specificity 96.3 %. Infants with pertussis had more often paroxysmal cough, absence of fever and a higher absolute lymphocyte count than infants without pertussis. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis is a serious disease in infants and it is often unrecognized; some features should help pediatricians to suspect pertussis, but clinical suspicion has a low sensitivity.

METHODS: From September to December 2014, NHs in Corsica were invited to participate in an ongoing daily epidemiological and microbiological surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) among residents and health care workers (HCWs). RESULTS: The study involved 12 NHs. Respiratory illness meeting the ILI case definition was observed among 44 residents from whom 22 specimens were collected. Of the 22 residents with a nasopharyngeal sample, 13 (59 %) were positive for at least one of the 11 pathogens analysed. Among these 13 patients, 11 (92 %) presented a confirmed influenza (A/H3N2) and two had another respiratory virus: one human metapneumovirus and one human coronavirus. Of patients with a confirmed influenza A(H3N2), 10 (91 %) were vaccinated against influenza during the 2014–2015 season. Two influenza outbreaks were reported in two NHs, caused by influenza A(H3N2) strains belonging to cluster 3C.3 and 3C.2a. Although antivirals were available, prophylaxis was not used. CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analysis seems to suggest no multiple introduction into the two NHs reporting the two influenza A(H3N2) outbreaks. A number of factors could have contributed to transmitting influenza in NHs including, the absence of administration of antiviral treatment for prophylaxis of all residents/staff regardless of immunization status because of the poor vaccine match during each outbreak, the intensive contacts with incompletely protected residents and HCWs, and the low adherence of NHs to notification of ILI outbreaks to the health authorities.

Integrins are important for setting the parameters of this resting state, particularly the epithelial-restricted αVβ6 integrin, which is upregulated during injury. Once expressed, αVβ6 moderates acute lung injury (ALI) through as yet undefined molecular mechanisms. We show that the upregulation of β6 during influenza infection is involved in disease pathogenesis. β6-deficient mice (β6 KO) have increased survival during influenza infection likely due to the limited viral spread into the alveolar spaces leading to reduced ALI. Although the β6 KO have morphologically normal lungs, they harbor constitutively activated lung CD11b(+) alveolar macrophages (AM) and elevated type I IFN signaling activity, which we traced to the loss of β6-activated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Administration of exogenous TGF-β to β6 KO mice leads to reduced numbers of CD11b(+) AMs, decreased type I IFN signaling activity and loss of the protective phenotype during influenza infection. Protection extended to other respiratory pathogens such as Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia.

Ten specified pathogen-free (SPF) cats were transfused with pooled plasma from cats that had cleared Mhf bacteremia; five control cats received plasma from naïve SPF cats. After homologous challenge with Mhf, cats were monitored for 100 days using quantitative PCR, hematology, blood biochemistry, Coombs testing, flow cytometry, DnaK ELISA, and red blood cell (RBC) osmotic fragility (OF) measurement. Passively immunized cats were not protected against Mhf infection but, compared to control cats, showed significantly higher RBC OF and B lymphocyte (CD45R/B220(+)) counts and occasionally higher lymphocyte, monocyte and activated CD4(+) T lymphocyte (CD4(+)CD25(+)) counts; they also showed higher bilirubin, total protein and globulin levels compared to those of control cats.

Traditionally the microbiological diagnosis of these infections has been based on conventional methods including culture on artificial media for isolation of bacteria and fungi and cell cultures for virus and antibody or antigen detection using antigen-antibody reactions. The main drawback of the above mentioned methods is the time needed for an etiological diagnosis of the infection. The techniques based on molecular biology have drawn much attention in recent decades as tools for rapid diagnosis of infections. Some techniques are very expensive, especially those that can detect various microorganisms in the same reaction, therefore the question that arises is whether the cost of such testing is justified by the information obtained and by the clinical impact that its implementation will determine. In this article we make a review of the various techniques of molecular biology applied to the diagnosis of pneumonia and focus primarily on analysing the impact they may have on the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infections.",2016-07-31,"VilaEstapé,Jordi;Zboromyrska,Yuliya;VergaraGómez,Andrea;AlejoCancho,Izaskun;RubioGarcía,Elisa;Álvarez-Martínez,MiriamJosé;laBellacasaBrugada,JorgePuigde;MarcosMaeso,M.Ángeles",EnfermedadesInfecciosasyMicrobiologíaClínica,115839727,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X1630218X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X1630218X,1cno01un,

Although no licensed vaccine is currently available, an engineered version of the metastable RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein—stabilized in the pre-fusion (pre-F) conformation by “DS-Cav1” mutations—elicits high titer RSV-neutralizing responses. Moreover, pre-F-specific antibodies, often against the neutralization-sensitive antigenic site Ø in the membrane-distal head region of trimeric F glycoprotein, comprise a substantial portion of the human response to natural RSV infection. To focus the vaccine-elicited response to antigenic site Ø, we designed a series of RSV F immunogens that comprised the membrane-distal head of the F glycoprotein in its pre-F conformation. These “head-only” immunogens formed monomers, dimers, and trimers. Antigenic analysis revealed that a majority of the 70 engineered head-only immunogens displayed reactivity to site Ø-targeting antibodies, which was similar to that of the parent RSV F DS-Cav1 trimers, often with increased thermostability. We evaluated four of these head-only immunogens in detail, probing their recognition by antibodies, their physical stability, structure, and immunogenicity. When tested in naïve mice, a head-only trimer, half the size of the parent RSV F trimer, induced RSV titers, which were statistically comparable to those induced by DS-Cav1. When used to boost DS-Cav1-primed mice, two head-only RSV F immunogens, a dimer and a trimer, boosted RSV-neutralizing titers to levels that were comparable to those boosted by DS-Cav1, although with higher site Ø-directed responses. Our results provide proof-of-concept for the ability of the smaller head-only RSV F immunogens to focus the vaccine-elicited response to antigenic site Ø. Decent primary immunogenicity, enhanced physical stability, potential ease of manufacture, and potent immunogenicity upon boosting suggest these head-only RSV F immunogens, engineered to retain the pre-fusion conformation, may have advantages as candidate RSV vaccines.",2016-07-27,"Boyington,JeffreyC.;Joyce,M.Gordon;Sastry,Mallika;Stewart-Jones,GuillaumeB.E.;Chen,Man;Kong,Wing-Pui;Ngwuta,JoanO.;Thomas,PaulV.;Tsybovsky,Yaroslav;Yang,Yongping;Zhang,Baoshan;Chen,Lei;Druz,Aliaksandr;Georgiev,IvelinS.;Ko,Kiyoon;Zhou,Tongqing;Mascola,JohnR.;Graham,BarneyS.;Kwong,PeterD.",PLoSOne,17393924,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0159709;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27463224/,1nbocmux,

Suitable tools for live-cell imaging of enterovirus ROs are currently unavailable, as recombinant enteroviruses that carry genes that encode RO-anchored viral proteins tagged with fluorescent reporters have not been reported thus far. To overcome this limitation, we used a split green fluorescent protein (split-GFP) system, comprising a large fragment [strands 1 to 10; GFP(S1-10)] and a small fragment [strand 11; GFP(S11)] of only 16 residues. The GFP(S11) (GFP with S11 fragment) fragment was inserted into the 3A protein of the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), while the large fragment was supplied by transient or stable expression in cells. The introduction of GFP(S11) did not affect the known functions of 3A when expressed in isolation. Using correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM), we showed that GFP fluorescence was detected at ROs, whose morphologies are essentially identical to those previously observed for wild-type CVB3, indicating that GFP(S11)-tagged 3A proteins assemble with GFP(S1-10) to form GFP for illumination of bona fide ROs. It is well established that enterovirus infection leads to Golgi disintegration. Through live-cell imaging of infected cells expressing an mCherry-tagged Golgi marker, we monitored RO development and revealed the dynamics of Golgi disassembly in real time. Having demonstrated the suitability of this virus for imaging ROs, we constructed a CVB3 encoding GFP(S1-10) and GFP(S11)-tagged 3A to bypass the need to express GFP(S1-10) prior to infection. These tools will have multiple applications in future studies on the origin, location, and function of enterovirus ROs. IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses induce the formation of membranous structures (replication organelles [ROs]) with a unique protein and lipid composition specialized for genome replication. Electron microscopy has revealed the morphology of enterovirus ROs, and immunofluorescence studies have been conducted to investigate their origin and formation. Yet, immunofluorescence analysis of fixed cells results in a rather static view of RO formation, and the results may be compromised by immunolabeling artifacts. While live-cell imaging of ROs would be preferred, enteroviruses encoding a membrane-anchored viral protein fused to a large fluorescent reporter have thus far not been described. Here, we tackled this constraint by introducing a small tag from a split-GFP system into an RO-resident enterovirus protein. This new tool bridges a methodological gap by circumventing the need for immunolabeling fixed cells and allows the study of the dynamics and formation of enterovirus ROs in living cells.",2016-07-06,"vanderSchaar,H.M.;Melia,C.E.;vanBruggen,J.A.C.;Strating,J.R.P.M.;vanGeenen,M.E.D.;Koster,A.J.;Bárcena,M.;vanKuppeveld,F.J.M.",mSphere,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4935779/,1aptufp6,

The cause of pneumonia after introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has not been well studied in low-income and middle-income countries, and most data are from cross-sectional studies of children admitted to hospital. We aimed to longitudinally investigate the incidence and causes of childhood pneumonia in a South African birth cohort. Methods We did a nested case-control study of children in the Drakenstein Child Health Study who developed pneumonia from May 29, 2012, to Dec 1, 2014. Children received immunisations including acellular pertussis vaccine and PCV13. A nested subgroup had nasopharyngeal swabs collected every 2 weeks throughout infancy. We identified pneumonia episodes and collected blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, and induced sputum specimens. We used multiplex real-time PCR to detect pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs and induced sputum of pneumonia cases and in nasopharyngeal swabs of age-matched and site-matched controls. To show associations between organisms and pneumonia we used conditional logistic regression; results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Findings 314 pneumonia cases occurred (incidence of 0·27 episodes per child-year, 95% CI 0·24–0·31; median age 5 months [IQR 3–9]) in 967 children during 1145 child-years of follow-up. 60 (21%) cases of pneumonia were severe (incidence 0·05 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0·04–0·07]) with a case fatality ratio of 1% (three deaths). A median of five organisms (IQR 4–6) were detected in cases and controls with nasopharyngeal swabs, and a median of six organisms (4–7) recorded in induced sputum (p=0·48 compared with nasopharyngeal swabs). Bordetella pertussis (OR 11·08, 95% CI 1·33–92·54), respiratory syncytial virus (8·05, 4·21–15·38), or influenza virus (4·13, 2·06–8·26) were most strongly associated with pneumonia; bocavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, Haemophilus influenzae, and cytomegalovirus were also associated with pneumonia. In cases, testing of induced sputum in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs provided incremental yield for detection of B pertussis and several viruses. Interpretation Pneumonia remains common in this highly vaccinated population. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequently detected pathogen associated with pneumonia; influenza virus and B pertussis were also strongly associated with pneumonia. Testing of induced sputum increases the yield for detection of several organisms. New vaccines and strategies are needed to address the burden of childhood pneumonia.

This family includes T cell receptor (TCR) that is critically involved in immune diseases such as autoimmune arthritis. In the present study, we provide compelling experimental in vivo evidence in support of our hypothesis. Using the SCHOOL approach and the SARS-CoV fusion peptide sequence, we rationally designed a novel immunomodulatory peptide that targets TCR. We showed that this peptide ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice and protects against bone and cartilage damage.

METHODS: PowerChek (Kogene Biotech, Korea), DiaPlexQ (SolGent, Korea), Anyplex (Seegene, Korea), AccuPower (Bioneer, Korea), LightMix (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Switzerland), and UltraFast kits (Nanobiosys, Korea) were evaluated. Limits of detection (LOD) with 95% probability values were estimated by testing 16 replicates of upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) RNA transcripts. Specificity was estimated by using 28 nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for other respiratory viruses. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using 18 lower respiratory specimens. The sensitivity test panel and the high inhibition panel were composed of nine specimens each, including eight and six specimens that were positive for MERS-CoV, respectively. RESULTS: The LODs for upE ranged from 21.88 to 263.03 copies/reaction, and those for ORF1a ranged from 6.92 to 128.82 copies/reaction. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses was found. All six kits correctly identified 8 of 8 (100%) positive clinical specimens.

In the majority of cases, the cause of the fever is unknown. Although respiratory viruses are commonly associated with this condition, the etiologic significance of this finding remains unclear and is therefore the subject of this study. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected during 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia in children age 0–18 years, being treated at a children’s oncology unit between January 2013 and June 2014. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. Follow-up samples were collected from children who tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Rhinoviruses were genotyped by VP4/VP2 sequencing. Fisher’s exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for group comparisons. RESULTS: At least one respiratory virus was detected in samples from 39 of 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia (45%), with rhinoviruses the most frequently detected. Follow-up samples were collected after a median of 28 days (range, 9–74 days) in 32 of the 39 virus-positive episodes. The respiratory viral infection had resolved in 25 episodes (78%).

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a convenience sample of 206 primary healthcare professionals at the MNG-HA. A self-reporting questionnaire was used to investigate the attitudes, awareness, satisfaction, and methods regarding health promotion practices of primary healthcare professionals. Results: Of the 206 primary healthcare professionals surveyed, 58.1% reported awareness of health promotion programs conducted in the hospitals and 64.6% reported that the health promotion system in the hospitals needs to be improved. Language barriers and cultural beliefs were viewed as obstacles to carrying out effective health promotion by 65% and 64.6% of primary healthcare professionals, respectively. The majority (79.9%) of the primary healthcare professionals perceived themselves as having the necessary skills to promote health and 80.6% believed that printed educational materials are the most prevalent method of health promotion/education, whereas 55.8% reported that counseling was the most preferred method of health promotion. Conclusion: The awareness level of health promotion policies, strategies, and programs conducted in the hospitals was not found to be satisfactory.

Although most such infections are viral in origin, it is difficult to differentiate bacterial and viral infections, as the clinical symptoms are similar. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods allow testing for multiple pathogens simultaneously and are, therefore, gaining interest. This prospective case-control study was conducted from October 2013 to February 2014. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (throat) swabs were obtained from children admitted with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) at a tertiary hospital. A control group of 40 asymptomatic children was included. Testing for 16 viruses was done by real-time multiplex PCR. Multiplex PCR detected a viral pathogen in 159/177 (89.9 %) patients admitted with SARI. There was a high rate of co-infection (46.9 %). Dual detections were observed in 64 (36.2 %), triple detections in 17 (9.6 %), and quadruple detections in 2 (1.1 %) of 177 samples. Seventy-eight patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, of whom 28 (35.8 %) had co-infection with multiple viruses. AdV, HBoV, HRV, HEV, and HCoV-OC43 were also detected among asymptomatic children. This study confirms the high rate of detection of viral nucleic acids by multiplex PCR among hospitalized children admitted with SARI, as well as the high rate of co-detection of multiple viruses.

A high morbidity has been reported for diarrhea (calves ≤ 35 %; piglets ≤ 50 %) and for respiratory diseases (calves ≤ 80 %; piglets ≤ 40 %). Despite a highly diverse etiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, treatment with antimicrobials is often the first-line therapy. Multi-antimicrobial resistance in pathogens results in international accordance to strengthen the research in novel treatment options. Medicinal plants bear a potential as alternative or additional treatment. Based on the versatile effects of their plant specific multi-component-compositions, medicinal plants can potentially act as ‘multi-target drugs’. Regarding the plurality of medicinal plants, the aim of this systematic review was to identify potential medicinal plant species for prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases and for modulation of the immune system and inflammation in calves and piglets. RESULTS: Based on nine initial sources including standard textbooks and European ethnoveterinary studies, a total of 223 medicinal plant species related to the treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases was identified. A defined search strategy was established using the PRISMA statement to evaluate 30 medicinal plant species starting from 20’000 peer-reviewed articles published in the last 20 years (1994–2014). This strategy led to 418 references (257 in vitro, 84 in vivo and 77 clinical trials, thereof 48 clinical trials in veterinary medicine) to evaluate effects of medicinal plants and their efficacy in detail. The findings indicate that the most promising candidates for gastrointestinal diseases are Allium sativum L., Mentha x piperita L. and Salvia officinalis L.; for diseases of the respiratory tract Echinacea purpurea (L.) MOENCH, Thymus vulgaris L. and Althea officinalis L. were found most promising, and Echinacea purpurea (L.) MOENCH, Camellia sinensis (L.) KUNTZE, Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Origanum vulgare L. were identified as best candidates for modulation of the immune system and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Several medicinal plants bear a potential for novel treatment strategies for young livestock. There is a need for further research focused on gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves and piglets, and the findings of this review provide a basis on plant selection for future studies.

Here we report cloning and characterization of a panel of nonhuman primate IFITMs. We show that, similar to human IFITM, nonhuman primate IFITM proteins inhibit HIV and other primate lentiviruses. While some nonhuman primate IFITM proteins are more potent than human counterparts to inhibit HIV-1, they are generally not effective against HIV-2 similar to that of human IFITMs. Notably, depending on SIV strains and also IFITM species tested, nonhuman primate IFITM proteins exhibit distinct activities against SIVs; no correlation was found to support the notion that IFITM proteins are most active in non-natural primate hosts. Consistent with our recent findings for human IFITMs, nonhuman primate IFITM proteins interact with HIV-1 Env and strongly act in viral producer cells to impair viral infectivity and block cell-to-cell transmission. Accordingly, knockdown of primate IFITM3 increases HIV-1 replication in nohuman primate cells. Interestingly, analysis of DNA sequences of human and nonhuman primate IFITMs suggest that IFITM proteins have been undergoing purifying selection, rather than positive selection typical for cellular restriction factors.

Though ARDS diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, biological markers of acute lung damage have been extensively studied in adults and children. Biomarkers of inflammation, alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial disruption, disordered coagulation, and associated derangements measured in the circulation and other body fluids, such as bronchoalveolar lavage, have improved our understanding of pathobiology of ARDS. The biochemical signature of ARDS has been increasingly well described in adult populations, and this has led to the identification of molecular phenotypes to augment clinical classifications. However, there is a paucity of data from pediatric ARDS (pARDS) patients. Biomarkers and molecular phenotypes have the potential to identify patients at high risk of poor outcomes, and perhaps inform the development of targeted therapies for specific groups of patients. Additionally, because of the lower incidence of and mortality from ARDS in pediatric patients relative to adults and lack of robust clinical predictors of outcome, there is an ongoing interest in biological markers as surrogate outcome measures. The recent definition of pARDS provides additional impetus for the measurement of established and novel biomarkers in future pediatric studies in order to further characterize this disease process.

Mouse IFIT1 selectively inhibits viruses that lack 2'O-methylation of their mRNA 5' caps. Surprisingly, human IFIT1 does not share this antiviral specificity. Here, we resolve this discrepancy by demonstrating that human and mouse IFIT1 have evolved distinct functions using a combination of evolutionary, genetic and virological analyses. First, we show that human IFIT1 and mouse IFIT1 (renamed IFIT1B) are not orthologs, but are paralogs that diverged >100 mya. Second, using a yeast genetic assay, we show that IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins differ in their ability to be suppressed by a cap 2'O-methyltransferase. Finally, we demonstrate that IFIT1 and IFIT1B have divergent antiviral specificities, including the discovery that only IFIT1 proteins inhibit a virus encoding a cap 2'O-methyltransferase. These functional data, combined with widespread turnover of mammalian IFIT genes, reveal dramatic species-specific differences in IFIT-mediated antiviral repertoires.

While local infection often remains asymptomatic, severe or even fatal diseases occur when streptococci become invasive and spread to different sites in the infected host. We have established porcine respiratory air-liquid interface cultures (ALI) from the porcine lung to analyze the interaction of streptococci with their primary target cells. As representative of the streptococcal family we chose Streptococcus suis (S. suis) that is not only a major swine respiratory pathogen but can also infect humans. Suilysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), is an important virulence factor. By comparing a S. suis wt strain with a suilysin-deficient mutant, we demonstrate that suilysin contributes to (i) adherence to airway cells (ii) loss of ciliated cells (iii) apoptosis, and (iv) invasion. Furthermore, we show that cytolytic activity of suilysin is crucial for these effects. A striking result of our analysis was the high efficiency of S. suis-induced apoptosis and invasion upon infection under ALI conditions. These properties have been reported to be less efficient when analyzed with immortalized cells.

We have examined this directly by a comparative RNA-Seq analysis of KBM-7 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and KBM-7 cells in which the NUDT2 Ap(4)A hydrolase gene had been disrupted (NuKO cells), causing a 175-fold increase in intracellular Ap(4)A. 6,288 differentially expressed genes were identified with P < 0.05. Of these, 980 were up-regulated and 705 down-regulated in NuKO cells with a fold-change ≥ 2. Ingenuity(®) Pathway Analysis (IPA(®)) was used to assign these genes to known canonical pathways and functional networks. Pathways associated with interferon responses, pattern recognition receptors and inflammation scored highly in the down-regulated set of genes while functions associated with MHC class II antigens were prominent among the up-regulated genes, which otherwise showed little organization into major functional gene sets. Tryptophan catabolism was also strongly down-regulated as were numerous genes known to be involved in tumor promotion in other systems, with roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Conversely, some pro-apoptotic genes were up-regulated. Major upstream factors predicted by IPA(®) for gene down-regulation included NFκB, STAT1/2, IRF3/4 and SP1 but no major factors controlling gene up-regulation were identified. Potential mechanisms for gene regulation mediated by Ap(4)A and/or NUDT2 disruption include binding of Ap(4)A to the HINT1 co-repressor, autocrine activation of purinoceptors by Ap(4)A, chromatin remodeling, effects of NUDT2 loss on transcript stability, and inhibition of ATP-dependent regulatory factors such as protein kinases by Ap(4)A. Existing evidence favors the last of these as the most probable mechanism. Regardless, our results suggest that the NUDT2 protein could be a novel cancer chemotherapeutic target, with its inhibition potentially exerting strong anti-tumor effects via multiple pathways involving metastasis, invasion, immunosuppression and apoptosis.",2016-05-04,"Marriott,AndrewS.;Vasieva,Olga;Fang,Yongxiang;Copeland,NikkiA.;McLennan,AlexanderG.;Jones,NigelJ.",PLoSOne,16391375,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27144453/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0154674,0ozzbp85,

A previous work demonstrated that the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 is able to hinder rotavirus replication both in vitro and in vivo. The present study takes a systematic approach in order to identify the molecule directly involved in rotavirus inhibition. Supernatant protease digestions revealed both the proteinaceous nature of the active substance and the fact that the molecule responsible for inhibiting rotavirus replication is released to the supernatant. Following purification by cationic exchange chromatography, active fractions were obtained and the functional compound was identified as an 11-amino acid peptide (MHQPHQPLPPT, named 11-mer peptide) with a molecular mass of 1.282 KDa. The functionality of 11-mer was verified using the synthesized peptide in Wa, Ito, and VA70 rotavirus infections of both HT-29 and MA-104 cell lines.

We propose advanced infection control measures (A-IC) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures (B-IC) help reduce pathogen transmission. B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC. OBJECTIVE: Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flagging system; infection prevention and control team on-call protocols; pretransfer MERS-CoV testing; and education. RESULTS: A total of 874 real-time polymerase chain reaction MERS-CoV tests were performed during the period beginning July 1, 2013, and ending January 31, 2015. Six hundred ninety-four non-HCWs were tested, of these 16 tested positive for MERS-CoV and their infection was community acquired. Sixty-nine percent of the confirmed MERS-CoV-positive cases were men, with an average age of 56 years (range, 19-84 years). Of the total tested for MERS-CoV, 180 individuals were HCWs with zero positivity.

In fact, besides being involved in primary defense against infections–mainly through phagocytosis, generation of toxic molecules, release of toxic enzymes and formation of extracellular traps–neutrophils have been shown to play a role in finely regulating the development and the evolution of inflammatory and immune responses. These latter neutrophil-mediated functions occur by a variety of mechanisms, including the production of newly manufactured cytokines. Herein, we provide a general overview of the chemotactic cytokines/chemokines that neutrophils can potentially produce, either under inflammatory/immune reactions or during their activation in more prolonged processes, such as in tumors. We highlight recent observations generated from studying human or rodent neutrophils in vitro and in vivo models. We also discuss the biological significance of neutrophil-derived chemokines in the context of infectious, neoplastic and immune-mediated diseases. The picture that is emerging is that, given their capacity to produce and release chemokines, neutrophils exert essential functions in recruiting, activating and modulating the activities of different leukocyte populations.",2016-04-30,"Tecchio,Cristina;Cassatella,MarcoA.",SeminarsinImmunology,4860837,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1044532316300173;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044532316300173;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27151246/;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smim.2016.04.003,1t1kq1kd,

Accounting for behavioural mechanisms that determine uptake of infectious disease interventions such as vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can significantly alter predicted health outcomes in a population. However, most previous approaches that model interactions between human behaviour and disease dynamics have modelled behaviour of these two interventions separately. Here, we develop and analyze an agent based network model to gain insights into how behaviour toward both interventions interact adaptively with disease dynamics (and therefore, indirectly, with one another) during the course of a single epidemic where an SIRV infection spreads through a contact network. In the model, individuals decide to become vaccinated and/or practice NPIs based on perceived infection prevalence (locally or globally) and on what other individuals in the network are doing. We find that introducing adaptive NPI behaviour lowers vaccine uptake on account of behavioural feedbacks, and also decreases epidemic final size. When transmission rates are low, NPIs alone are as effective in reducing epidemic final size as NPIs and vaccination combined. Also, NPIs can compensate for delays in vaccine availability by hindering early disease spread, decreasing epidemic size significantly compared to the case where NPI behaviour does not adapt to mitigate early surges in infection prevalence. We also find that including adaptive NPI behaviour strongly mitigates the vaccine behavioural feedbacks that would otherwise result in higher vaccine uptake at lower vaccine efficacy as predicted by most previous models, and the same feedbacks cause epidemic final size to remain approximately constant across a broad range of values for vaccine efficacy. Finally, when individuals use local information about others’ behaviour and infection prevalence, instead of population-level information, infection is controlled more efficiently through ring vaccination, and this is reflected in the time evolution of pair correlations on the network. This model shows that accounting for both adaptive NPI behaviour and adaptive vaccinating behaviour regarding social effects and infection prevalence can result in qualitatively different predictions than if only one type of adaptive behaviour is modelled.",2016-04-21,"Andrews,MichaelA.;Bauch,ChrisT.",JournalofTheoreticalBiology,37609601,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26829313/;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.01.027;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519316000667;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519316000667,1152vpv5,

After the founding of The People's Republic of China, from 1949 till date, all levels of government, from central to local, have been attaching great importance to schistosomiasis control in The People's Republic of China. With considerable policy support and resources mobilization, the national schistosomiasis control programmes have been implemented during the past 65 years. Here, we summarize the successful experience of schistosomiasis control during the process. Recommendations for the future management of the Chinese national schistosomiasis elimination programme are put forward after considering the remaining challenges, shortcomings and lessons learnt from 65 years of schistosomiasis control drives in The People's Republic of China.

The pathogenesis and the transmission mode of this virus are still not well understood. The name of the virus is derived from the area of its appearance and the genomic sequence that was used in the development of qRT-PCR assays for MERS-CoV detection was retrieved from the first detected case isolate. The employed assays target various regions including the area upstream of the envelope gene (upE) that is used for screening and the open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b used for confirmation. AIM: This study assesses the use of a MERS-CoV specific assay for screening of respiratory samples in anticipation of the possible spread of the virus in the region. METHODS: 46 respiratory specimens were tested using the qualitative one-step qRT-PCR GeneSig Human Coronavirus 2012 (MERS) kit (PrimerDesign™). RESULTS: Out of the 46 tested samples, 45 were negative for MERS-CoV and one sample was found MERS-CoV positive.

Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a powerful method for nucleic acid detection and absolute quantification. However, it requires thermal cycling and accurate temperature control, which are difficult in resource-limited conditions. Accordingly, isothermal methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), are more attractive. We developed a picoliter well array (PWA) chip with 27,000 consistently sized picoliter reactions (314 pL) for isothermal DNA quantification using digital RPA (dRPA) at 39°C. Sample loading using a scraping liquid blade was simple, fast, and required small reagent volumes (i.e., <20 μL). Passivating the chip surface using a methoxy-PEG-silane agent effectively eliminated cross-contamination during dRPA. Our creative optical design enabled wide-field fluorescence imaging in situ and both end-point and real-time analyses of picoliter wells in a 6-cm(2) area. It was not necessary to use scan shooting and stitch serial small images together. Using this method, we quantified serial dilutions of a Listeria monocytogenes gDNA stock solution from 9 × 10(-1) to 4 × 10(-3) copies per well with an average error of less than 11% (N = 15). Overall dRPA-on-chip processing required less than 30 min, which was a 4-fold decrease compared to dPCR, requiring approximately 2 h. dRPA on the PWA chip provides a simple and highly sensitive method to quantify nucleic acids without thermal cycling or precise micropump/microvalve control.

Currently, there is no effective vaccine available to protect the pigs from PEDV. The N-terminal subunit of spike protein (S1) is responsible for virus binding to the cellular receptor and contains a number of neutralizing antibody epitopes. Thus, we expressed and produced recombinant S1 protein to protect newborn piglets by immunization of sows. METHODS: Affinity tagged PEDV S1 protein was expressed in a secretory form in yeast, insect and mammalian cells to identify the most suitable production system. Purified recombinant protein was analysed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and deglycosylation assay. A pregnant sow was intramuscularly immunized three times with adjuvanted recombinant protein prior to farrowing. PEDV-specific immune responses in sera and colostrum of the sow and piglets were assayed by ELISA and virus neutralization assays. Piglets were challenged orally with PEDV, and clinical parameters were monitored for 6 days post-challenge. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Of three eukaryotic expression systems tested (yeast, insect-cell, and mammalian), expression by HEK-293 T cells gave the highest yield of protein that was N-glycosylated and was the most appropriate candidate for vaccination. Administration of the subunit vaccine in a sow resulted in induction of S1-specific IgG and IgA that were passively transferred to the suckling piglets. Also, high virus neutralization titres were observed in the serum of the vaccinated sow and its piglets. After PEDV challenge, piglets born to the vaccinated sow exhibited less severe signs of disease and significantly lower mortality compared to the piglets of a control sow. However, there were no significant differences in diarrhea, body weight and virus shedding. Thus, vaccination with S1 subunit vaccine failed to provide complete protection to suckling piglets after challenge exposure, and further improvements are needed for the development of a subunit vaccine that fully protects against PEDV infection.",2016-04-01,"Makadiya,Niraj;Brownlie,Robert;vandenHurk,Jan;Berube,Nathalie;Allan,Brenda;Gerdts,Volker;Zakhartchouk,Alexander",VirolJ,14791114,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0512-8;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27036203/,1r3doeic,

The internal proteins of batFLUAV are functional in mammalian cells. In contrast, no biological functionality could be demonstrated for the surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA)-like (HAL) and neuraminidase (NA)-like (NAL), and these proteins need to be replaced by their human counterparts to allow spread of batFLUAV in human cells. Here, we employed rhabdoviral vectors to study the role of HAL and NAL in viral entry. Vectors pseudotyped with batFLUAV-HAL and -NAL were able to enter bat cells but not cells from other mammalian species. Host cell entry was mediated by HAL and was dependent on prior proteolytic activation of HAL and endosomal low pH. In contrast, sialic acids were dispensable for HAL-driven entry. Finally, the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 was able to activate HAL for cell entry indicating that batFLUAV can utilize human proteases for HAL activation. Collectively, these results identify viral and cellular factors governing host cell entry driven by batFLUAV surface proteins. They suggest that the absence of a functional receptor precludes entry of batFLUAV into human cells while other prerequisites for entry, HAL activation and protonation, are met in target cells of human origin.",2016-03-30,"Hoffmann,Markus;Krüger,Nadine;Zmora,Pawel;Wrensch,Florian;Herrler,Georg;Pöhlmann,Stefan",PLoSOne,1656336,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152134;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27028521/,0ejhd9nw,

Given the precedent for other picornaviruses which use terminal sialic acids (SAs) as receptors, we examined the role of SAs in PSV binding and infection. Using a variety of approaches, including treating cells with a carbohydrate-destroying chemical (NaIO(4)), mono- or oligosaccharides (N-acetylneuraminic acid, galactose, and 6′-sialyllactose), linkage-specific sialidases (neuraminidase and sialidase S), lectins (Maakia amurensis lectin and Sambucus nigra lectin), proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin), and glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors (dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol and phospholipase C), we demonstrated that PSV could recognize α2,3-linked SA on glycolipids as a receptor. On the other hand, PSVs had no binding affinity for synthetic histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), suggesting that PSVs could not use HBGAs as receptors. Depletion of cell surface glycolipids followed by reconstitution studies indicated that GD1a ganglioside, but not other gangliosides, could restore PSV binding and infection, further confirming α2,3-linked SA on GD1a as a PSV receptor.

RSV accounts for approximately 70% of all these cases, followed by rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus.

Importantly, the proteinase and RNA-binding activity of 3C(pro) are involved in viral polyprotein processing and the initiation of viral RNA synthesis. In addition, 3C(pro) can induce the cleavage of certain cellular factors required for transcription, translation and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to modulate cell physiology for viral replication. Due to interactions between 3C(pro) and these essential factors, 3C(pro) is also involved in viral pathogenesis to support efficient infection.

Important differences existed between and among them in terms of nature and extent of reporting. Here, we assess the implementation of these systems from different perspectives, including a description and comparison of collected data, disease metrics, usefulness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, representativeness, timeliness, and stability. This assessment demonstrates the limitations that the absence of premises identification imposes on certain animal health surveillance and response databases, and the importance of federally regulated frameworks in collecting accurate information in a timely manner.

Here, we describe the preparation of bioactive codon-optimized recombinant truncated Ulp1 (Leu403-Lys621) (rtUlp1) of S. cerevisiae in Escherichia coli using only one-step with Ni–NTA affinity chromatograph, and the application of rtUlp1 to cleave the SUMO fusion protein by simply mixing the purified rtUlp1, SUMO fusion protein and DL-Dithiothreitol in Tris–HCl buffer. The optimal expression level of non-fusion protein rtUlp1 accounts for approximately 50 % of the total cellular protein and 36 % of the soluble form by addition of isopropyl β-D-l-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mM at 18 °C for 20 h. The purification of target protein rtUlp1 was conducted by Ni–NTA affinity chromatography. The final yield of rtUlp1 was 45 mg/l in flask fermentation with a purity up to 95 %. Furthermore, the high purity of rtUlp1 could effectively cleave the SUMO-tTβRII fusion protein (SUMO gene fused to truncated transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II gene) with the above simplified approach, and the specific activity of the rtUlp1 reached up to 2.8 × 10(4) U/mg, which is comparable to the commercial Ulp1.

Apoptotic cell recognition and removal from the lung is mediated predominantly by airway macrophages, though immature dendritic cells and non-professional phagocytes, such as epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells, can also display this function. Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells from the airways is essential for successful resolution of inflammation and the return to lung homeostasis. Disruption of this process leads to secondary necrosis of accumulating apoptotic cells, release of necrotic cell debris and subsequent uncontrolled inflammatory activation of the innate immune system by the released ‘damage associated molecular patterns’ (DAMPS). To control the duration of the immune response and prevent autoimmune reactions, anti-inflammatory signalling cascades are initiated in the phagocyte upon apoptotic cell uptake, mediated by a range of receptors that recognise specific phospholipids or proteins externalised on, or secreted by, the apoptotic cell. However, prolonged activation of apoptotic cell recognition receptors, such as the family of receptor tyrosine kinases Tyro3, Axl and MerTK (TAM), may delay or prevent inflammatory responses to subsequent infections. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism controlling apoptotic cell recognition and removal from the lung in homeostasis and during inflammation, the contribution of defective efferocytosis to chronic inflammatory lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and cystic fibrosis, and implications of the signals triggered by apoptotic cells in the susceptibility to pulmonary microbial infections.",2016-03-08,"Grabiec,AleksanderM.;Hussell,Tracy",SeminImmunopathol,804810,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-016-0555-3;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26957481/,1f47gvys,

Recently, RNA degradation in vivo was observed in patients with locally advanced breast cancer, where mid-treatment tumor RNA degradation was associated with complete tumor destruction and enhanced patient survival. However, it is not clear how widespread chemotherapy induced “RNA disruption” is, the extent to which it is associated with drug response or what the underlying mechanisms are. METHODS: Ovarian (A2780, CaOV3) and breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, BT474, SKBR3) cancer cell lines were treated with several cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs and total RNA was isolated. RNA was also prepared from docetaxel resistant A2780DXL and carboplatin resistant A2780CBN cells following drug exposure. Disruption of RNA was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. Northern blotting was performed using probes complementary to the 28S and 18S rRNA to determine the origins of degradation bands. Apoptosis activation was assessed by flow cytometric monitoring of annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) binding to cells and by measuring caspase-3 activation. The link between apoptosis and RNA degradation (disruption) was investigated using a caspase-3 inhibitor. RESULTS: All chemotherapy drugs tested were capable of inducing similar RNA disruption patterns. Docetaxel treatment of the resistant A2780DXL cells and carboplatin treatment of the A2780CBN cells did not result in RNA disruption. Northern blotting indicated that two RNA disruption bands were derived from the 3’-end of the 28S rRNA. Annexin-V and PI staining of docetaxel treated cells, along with assessment of caspase-3 activation, showed concurrent initiation of apoptosis and RNA disruption, while inhibition of caspase-3 activity significantly reduced RNA disruption. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting the in vivo evidence, our results demonstrate that RNA disruption is induced by multiple chemotherapy agents in cell lines from different tissues and is associated with drug response. Although present, the link between apoptosis and RNA disruption is not completely understood. Evaluation of RNA disruption is thus proposed as a novel and effective biomarker to assess response to chemotherapy drugs in vitro and in vivo.

We demonstrated by electron microscopy the presence of herpesvirus-like particles in the microbat cells. Passage of supernatants from microbat cells to Vero cells resulted in syncytium formation, and expression of viral genes and amplification of viral DNA were demonstrated by quantitative PCR. Susceptibility of human cell lines to productive infection was also demonstrated. Next-generation sequencing and de novo assembly of the viral genome from supernatants from Vero cells yielded a single contig of approximately 130 kb with at least 77 open reading frames (ORFs), predicted microRNAs (miRNAs), and a gammaherpesvirus genomic organization.

In the case of HIV, it has been shown that CBAs select for mutant viruses with N-glycosylation site deletions which are more sensitive to neutralizing antibodies.

Surprisingly, none of these mutations, alone or in combination, conferred resistance to CBAs. In contrast, we observed that some mutants were more sensitive to 3/11 or CD81-LEL inhibition. Additionally, several mutations were identified in the Core and the non-structural proteins.

Additionally, for many RNA viruses, replication to high titers results in the production of defective interfering particles (DIs) that also attenuate infection. We hypothesized that fidelity, recombination, and DI production are tightly linked. We show that a Sindbis virus mutator replicating at a high multiplicity of infection manifests an earlier and greater accumulation of DIs than its wild-type counterpart. The isolated DIs interfere with the replication of full-length virus in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the ability of the mutator virus to overproduce DIs could be linked to an increased recombination frequency. These data confirm that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fidelity and recombination are inversely correlated for this mutator. Our findings suggest that defective interference resulting from higher recombination rates may be more detrimental to RNA virus mutators than the increase in mutational burden. IMPORTANCE Replication, adaptation, and evolution of RNA viruses rely in large part on their low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses artificially modified in their polymerases to decrease fidelity (mutator viruses) are attenuated in vivo, demonstrating the important role of fidelity in viral fitness. However, attenuation was attributed solely to the modification of the viral mutation rate and the accumulation of detrimental point mutations. In this work, we described an additional phenotype of mutator viruses: an increased recombination rate leading to defective interfering particle (DI) overproduction. Because DIs are known for their inhibitory effect on viral replication, our work suggests that fidelity variants may be attenuated in vivo via several mechanisms.

METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys of Australians pilgrims aged ≥18 years were undertaken, one before and one after the Hajj 2014. RESULTS: Of 356 pilgrims who completed the survey (response rate 94%), 80% had the influenza vaccine, 30% the pneumococcal vaccine, and 30% the pertussis vaccine. Concern about contracting disease at Hajj was the most cited reason for vaccination (73.4%), and not being aware of vaccine availability was the main reason for non-receipt (56%). Those who obtained pre-travel advice were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not seek advice. Of 150 pilgrims surveyed upon return, 94% reported practicing hand hygiene during Hajj, citing ease of use (67%) and belief in its effectiveness (62.4%) as the main reasons for compliance; university education was a significant predictor of hand hygiene adherence. Fifty-three percent used facemasks, with breathing discomfort (76%) and a feeling of suffocation (40%) being the main obstacles to compliance. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that there are significant opportunities to improve awareness among Australian Hajj pilgrims about the importance of using preventive health measures.",2016-02-10,"Alqahtani,AmaniS.;Wiley,KerrieE.;Tashani,Mohamed;Willaby,HaroldW.;Heywood,AnitaE.;BinDhim,NasserF.;Booy,Robert;Rashid,Harunor",IntJInfectDis,205277481,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26875699/;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971216000254;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216000254;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.02.005,0nrejsgr,

HCV replicates in the cytoplasm, and the synthesis of viral proteins induces extensive rearrangements of host cell membranes producing structures, collectively termed the membranous web (MW). The MW contains the sites of viral replication and assembly, and we have identified distinct membrane fractions derived from HCV-infected cells that contain replication and assembly complexes enriched for viral RNA and infectious virus, respectively. The complex membrane structure of the MW is thought to protect the viral genome limiting its interactions with cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and thereby preventing activation of cellular innate immune responses. Here we show that PRRs, including RIG-I and MDA5, and ribosomes are excluded from viral replication and assembly centers within the MW. Furthermore, we present evidence that components of the nuclear transport machinery regulate access of proteins to MW compartments. We show that the restricted assess of RIG-I to the MW can be overcome by the addition of a nuclear localization signal sequence, and that expression of a NLS-RIG-I construct leads to increased immune activation and the inhibition of viral replication.",2016-02-10,"Neufeldt,ChristopherJ.;Joyce,MichaelA.;VanBuuren,Nicholas;Levin,Aviad;Kirkegaard,Karla;GaleJr.,Michael;Tyrrell,D.LorneJ.;Wozniak,RichardW.",PLoSPathog,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4749181/,1kuggdzj,

It is caused by a new corona virus, called MERS corona virus (MERS-CoV). Most people who have MERS-CoV infection developed severe acute respiratory illness. Aim of the work This work is done to determine the clinical characteristics and the outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Patients and methods This study included 32 laboratory confirmed MERS corona virus infected patients who were admitted into ICU. It included 20 (62.50%) males and 12 (37.50%) females. The mean age was 43.99±13.03years. Diagnosis was done by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for corona virus on throat swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and outcome were reported for all subjects. Results The main symptoms among the included patients were: fever (96.87%), cough (93.75%), dyspnea (90.62%), sore throat (75%), runny nose (75%), sputum (50%), headache (43.75%), myalgia (40.62%), chest pain (37.50%), hemoptysis (37.50%), nausea and vomiting (34.37%), abdominal pain (21.87%) and diarrhea (15.62%). The presence of abdominal symptoms is significantly (P <0.05) associated with bad prognosis. Out of the included 32 patients, 18 patients (56.25%) survived and 14 patients (43.75%) expired. There was a statistically significant difference in the duration of symptoms before hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and ICU and total hospital stay between the expired group and survivors (P <0.01). Current smoking and smoking severity were statistically significantly (P <0.01) higher in the expired group compared to survivors. Also, there was a statistically (P <0.05) significant positive correlation between mortality and smoking severity (r =0.640). Most of the expired patients presented with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates or unilateral infiltrates, but most of the survivors presented with normal radiology or increased bronchovascular markings, and this difference in the results was statistically highly significant (P <0.01). There were statistically highly significant (P <0.01) differences in the mean values of APACHE II score (21.11±3.70 vs 24.21±3.82), SOFA score (5.83±2.64 vs 8.85±2.17) and CPIS (7.55±1.14 vs 8.64±1.39) between the expired group and survivors respectively. Also, there was a statistically significant decrease in PH, PaO2, O2 saturation and HCO3 (P <0.05) among the expired group in comparison with the survivors, but no statistical difference regarding PaCO2 (P >0.05). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between mortality and old age (r =0.633), obesity (r =0.712), diabetes mellitus (r =0.685), renal failure (r =0.705), chronic heart diseases (0.591), COPD (r =0.523), malignancy (r =0.692), kidney transplantation (r =0.644) and liver cirrhosis (r =0.525) (P <0.05). There was a statistically (P <0.05) positive correlation between the number of associated co-morbidities and mortality (r =0.735). Conclusions Most MERS corona patients present with fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, runny nose and sputum. The presence of abdominal symptoms may indicate bad prognosis. Prolonged duration of symptoms before patients’ hospitalization, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, bilateral radiological pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxemic respiratory failure were found to be strong predictors of mortality in such patients. Also, old age, current smoking, smoking severity, presence of associated co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart diseases, COPD, malignancy, renal failure, renal transplantation and liver cirrhosis are associated with a poor outcome of ICU admitted MERS corona virus infected patients.",2016-01-31,"Halim,AshrafAbdel;Alsayed,Badr;Embarak,Sameh;Yaseen,Taha;Dabbous,Salwa",EgyptianJournalofChestDiseasesandTuberculosis,73738159,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288128/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0422763815301199;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcdt.2015.11.011;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0422763815301199,0bb729sp,

Here, one such alternative, namely pig antibodies purified from slaughterhouse blood was investigated in order to elucidate its potential usability to control post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD), which is one of the top indications for antibiotics usage in the pig production. A very cost-efficient and rapid one-step expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography procedure was used to purify pig immunoglobulin G from slaughterhouse pig plasma (more than 100 litres), resulting in >85% pure pig IgG (ppIgG). The ppIgG thus comprised natural pig immunoglobulins and was subsequently shown to contain activity towards four pig-relevant bacterial strains (three different types of Escherichia coli and one type of Salmonella enterica) but not towards a fish pathogen (Yersinia ruckeri), and was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of the four pig relevant bacteria to a pig intestinal cell line (IPEC-J2). Finally it was demonstrated in an in vivo weaning piglet model for intestinal colonization with an E. coli F4+ challenge strain that ppIgG given in the feed significantly reduced shedding of the challenge strain, reduced the proportion of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae, increased the proportion of families Enterococcoceae and Streptococcaceae and generally increased ileal microbiota diversity. Conclusively, our data support the idea that natural IgG directly purified from pig plasma and given as a feed supplement can be used in modern swine production as an efficient and cost-effective means for reducing both occurrence of PWD and antibiotics usage and with a potential for the prevention and treatment of other intestinal infectious diseases even if the causative agent might not be known.",2016-01-29,"Hedegaard,ChrisJ.;Strube,MikaelL.;Hansen,MarieB.;Lindved,BodilK.;Lihme,Allan;Boye,Mette;Heegaard,PeterM.H.",PLoSOne,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4744083/,1tcpaigw,

Thus, computational methods play a pivotal role in generating plausible structures which can be used in the drug development process. In this review the accumulation of structural data is introduced from a historical perspective. Computational performances and their predictive power are reported guided by biological questions such as the assembly, mechanism of function and drug–protein interaction of VCPs.

Efficient eukaryotic −1 PRF requires an optimally placed stimulator structure downstream of the frameshifting site and different strategies targeting viral −1 PRF stimulators have been developed. However, accessing particular −1 PRF stimulator information represents a bottle-neck in combating the emerging epidemic viral pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recently, an RNA hairpin upstream of frameshifting site was shown to act as a cis-element to attenuate −1 PRF with mechanism unknown. Here, we show that an upstream duplex formed in-trans, by annealing an antisense to its complementary mRNA sequence upstream of frameshifting site, can replace an upstream hairpin to attenuate −1 PRF efficiently. This finding indicates that the formation of a proximal upstream duplex is the main determining factor responsible for −1 PRF attenuation and provides mechanistic insight. Additionally, the antisense-mediated upstream duplex approach downregulates −1 PRF stimulated by distinct −1 PRF stimulators, including those of MERS-CoV, suggesting its general application potential as a robust means to evaluating viral −1 PRF inhibition as soon as the sequence information of an emerging human coronavirus is available.",2016-01-08,"Hu,Hao-Teng;Cho,Che-Pei;Lin,Ya-Hui;Chang,Kung-Yao",NucleicAcidsRes,7337208,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1307;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26612863/,1u10lpx2,

In parallel, most viroporins identified so far are virulence factors, and interest has focused toward the discovery of channel inhibitors that would have a therapeutic effect, or be used as research tools to understand the biological roles of viroporin ion channel activity. However, this paradigm is being shifted by the difficulties inherent to small viral membrane proteins, and by the realization that protein–protein interactions and other diverse roles in the virus life cycle may represent an equal, if not, more important target. Therefore, although targeting the channel activity of viroporins can probably be therapeutically useful in some cases, the focus may shift to their other functions in following years. Small-molecule inhibitors have been mostly developed against the influenza A M2 (IAV M2 or AM2). This is not surprising since AM2 is the best characterized viroporin to date, with a well-established biological role in viral pathogenesis combined the most extensive structural investigations conducted, and has emerged as a validated drug target.

METHODS Archived specimens from a prospective, longitudinal study were tested for HBoV. A total of 94 children (aged 6-36 months) were HBoV(+) during 172 upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and/or acute otitis media (AOM) episodes. We used pyrosequencing of NP1, VP1 and VP2 genes to type HBoV and subtype HBoV1 in these specimens. RESULTS Of the specimens tested, HBoV-DNA were successfully sequenced in 128 (74%) samples from 70 children; all were HBoV type 1. Subtypes identified (n = 108) were LWK/TW (63%), LWK/BJ (20%), Bonn/BJ (16%) and LWK/KU3 (1%). Of 46 children for whom shedding pattern could be determined, viral clearance within 30 days (13-29 days) occurred in 28%; another 22% of children had no recurrence after 32-267 days. Prolonged virus presence of >30 days (34-181 days+) occurred in 22%; intermittent detection (61+ to 170+ days) in 20%. Infection with the same HBoV1 subtype after 4-5 negative samples (244 and 265 days interval) occurred in 4%. Infection with 2 different HBoV1 subtypes (29 and 87 days apart) occurred in only 4%. Newly acquired HBoV1-URI resulted in AOM in 53% of cases. CONCLUSIONS Children with HBoV1 infection commonly shed for a prolonged period leading to repeated viral DNA detection. Recurrence after 8-9 months suggests possible persistence and reactivation. Infections with 2 different HBoV1 subtypes within 1-year period are uncommon.

The VEEV nsP2 protease is a member of MEROPS Clan CN and characteristically contains a papain-like protease linked to an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferase (SAM MTase) domain. The protease contains an alternative active site motif, (475)NVCWAK(480), which differs from papain's (CGS(25)CWAFS), and the enzyme lacks a transition state-stabilizing residue homologous to Gln-19 in papain. To understand the roles of conserved residues in catalysis, we determined the structure of the free enzyme and the first structure of an inhibitor-bound alphaviral protease. The peptide-like E64d inhibitor was found to bind beneath a β-hairpin at the interface of the SAM MTase and protease domains. His-546 adopted a conformation that differed from that found in the free enzyme; one or both of the conformers may assist in leaving group departure of either the amine or Cys thiolate during the catalytic cycle. Interestingly, E64c (200 μM), the carboxylic acid form of the E64d ester, did not inhibit the nsP2 protease. To identify key residues involved in substrate binding, a number of mutants were analyzed. Mutation of the motif residue, N475A, led to a 24-fold reduction in kcat/Km, and the conformation of this residue did not change after inhibition. N475 forms a hydrogen bond with R662 in the SAM MTase domain, and the R662A and R662K mutations both led to 16-fold decreases in kcat/Km. N475 forms the base of the P1 binding site and likely orients the substrate for nucleophilic attack or plays a role in product release. An Asn homologous to N475 is similarly found in coronaviral papain-like proteases (PLpro) of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus. Mutation of another motif residue, K480A, led to a 9-fold decrease in kcat and kcat/Km. K480 likely enhances the nucleophilicity of the Cys. Consistent with our substrate-bound models, the SAM MTase domain K706A mutation increased Km 4.5-fold to 500 μM. Within the β-hairpin, the N545A mutation slightly but not significantly increased kcat and Km.

The disease was first described by Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki in 1967 from Japan. KD has now been reported from more than 60 countries and is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in children in the developed countries. Japan reports the highest incidence of KD at 265/100,000 children below 5 years, followed by Korea and Taiwan. In North America and Europe, the incidence of KD is much lower (9–25/100,000 children below 5) and appears to have plateaued down over the last few decades. The reasons for these differences in epidemiology are not clearly understood. KD has been increasingly reported from India over the last 20 years. At Chandigarh, an incidence of 4.54/100,000 children below 15 years was reported in 2011. However, this was likely to be an underestimate. The etiology of KD remains unknown. Although a genetic basis of KD seems plausible, an intercurrent infectious process seems to act as a trigger for the inflammatory cascade. Like many other vasculitides, the diagnosis of KD is essentially clinical and is based on a set of criteria first elaborated by Dr. Kawasaki himself. However, several children (especially infants) with KD can have incomplete and atypical presentations. This can result in diagnostic and therapeutic delays. Approximately 15–25% children with KD can develop coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) if left untreated. Two dimensional echocardiography remains the gold standard in detecting CAAs in patients with KD. Dual source CT coronary angiography is a recent advance in accurate detection of CAAs with minimal radiation risk. Intravenous immunoglobulin (2g/kg) remains the drug of choice and is administered as an infusion. Other therapeutic agents that have been used include infliximab, cyclosporine, glucocorticoids, and statins.

During the outbreak, the premises-level incidence of PEDv was 40.5 percent (90/222 sites). One of the three companies from which data were collected had a lower incidence (19.5 percent) than the other two companies (41.1 and 47.2 percent). Sow sites had the highest incidence of PEDv during the outbreak (80.0 percent). Spatial analysis showed that PEDv was clustered rather than randomly distributed, which suggested that sites near a positive site had increased risk of acquiring PEDv infection. Meteorological data were used to investigate the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. If airborne dissemination played a role in this outbreak, we would expect the direction of disease spread to correlate with the predominant wind direction. Two methods were used to determine the direction of disease spread—linear direction mean analysis in ArcGIS and the direction test in ClusterSeer. The former method indicated PEDv spread was south to slightly southwest, and the latter indicated spread was to the southeast. The predominant wind direction during the month of the outbreak was toward the south, with some southeast and southwest winds; the strongest wind gusts were toward the southwest. These findings support the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. The results, however, should be interpreted cautiously because we did not have information on direct and indirect contacts between sites, such as movement of trucks, feed, pigs or people. These types of contacts should be evaluated before pathogen spread is attributed to airborne mechanisms.

We aimed to assess the effect of azithromycin on the duration of respiratory episodes in young children with recurrent asthma-like symptoms, hypothesising that it reduces the duration of the symptomatic period. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited children aged 1–3 years, who were diagnosed with recurrent asthma-like symptoms from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 cohort; a birth cohort consisting of the general Danish population of Zealand, including Copenhagen. Exclusion criteria were macrolide allergy, heart, liver, neurological, and kidney disease, and, before each treatment, one or more clinical signs of pneumonia (respiratory frequency of ≥50 breaths per min; fever of ≥39°C; C-reactive protein concentration of ≥476·20 nmol/L [≥50 mg/L]). Each episode of asthma-like symptoms lasting at least 3 days was randomly allocated to a 3-day course of azithromycin oral solution of 10 mg/kg per day or placebo after thorough examination by a study physician at the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma research unit. Each episode was randomly allocated independently of previous treatment from a computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of ten (generated at the Pharmacy of Glostrup). Investigators and children were masked until the youngest child turned 3 years of age and throughout the data validation and analysis phases. The primary outcome was duration of the respiratory episode after treatment, verified by prospective daily diaries and analysed with Poisson regression. Analyses were per protocol (excluding those without a primary outcome measure or who did not receive treatment). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01233297. FINDINGS: Between Nov 17, 2010, and Jan 28, 2014, we randomly allocated 158 asthma-like episodes in 72 children (79 [50%] to azithromycin and 79 [50%] to placebo). The mean duration of the episode after treatment was 3·4 days for children receiving azithromycin compared with 7·7 days for children receiving placebo. Azithromycin caused a significant shortening of the episode of 63·3% (95% CI 56·0–69·3; p<0·0001). The effect size increased with early initiation of treatment, showing a reduction in episode duration of 83% if treatment was initiated before day 6 of the episode compared with 36% if initiated on or after day 6 (p<0·0001). We noted no differences in clinical adverse events between the azithromycin (18 [23%] of 78 episodes included in final analysis) and placebo (24 [30%] of 79) groups (p=0·30), but we did not investigate bacterial resistance patterns after treatment. INTERPRETATION: Azithromycin reduced the duration of episodes of asthma-like symptoms in young children, suggesting that this drug could have a role in acute management of exacerbations. Further research is needed to disentangle the inflammatory versus antimicrobial aspects of this relation.

Their contribution to rubella virus (RV)-induced apoptosis was addressed through time-specific evaluation of characteristic parameters such as permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent release of the pro-apoptotic proteins apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c from mitochondria. Additionally, expression and localization pattern of p53 and selected members of the multifunctional and stress-inducible cyclophilin family were examined. The application of pifithrin μ as an inhibitor of p53 shuttling to mitochondria reduced RV-induced cell death to an extent similar to that of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-V-A-D-(OMe)-fmk). However, RV progeny generation was not altered. This indicates that, despite an increased survival rate of its cellular host, induction of apoptosis neither supports nor restricts RV replication. Moreover, some of the examined apoptotic markers were affected in a strain-specific manner and differed between the cell culture-adapted strains: Therien and the HPV77 vaccine on the one hand, and a clinical isolate on the other.

In the Middle East and Arab countries, the burden of RSV-associated hospitalizations is not well characterized. We sought to determine the burden and clinical/epidemiological characteristics of RSV hospitalization in young children in Amman, Jordan. We investigated risk factors for severity including vitamin D levels. METHODS: We conducted viral surveillance with clinical and demographic data in children <2 years admitted with respiratory symptoms and/or fever at the Al-Bashir Government Hospital from March16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Nasal/throat swabs were obtained and placed into lysis buffer, and frozen at −80 °C until testing by real-time RT-PCR for 11 respiratory viruses. Heel stick blood or sera samples for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were obtained and sent to a central laboratory for mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Of the 3168 children, >80% testing positive for one virus, with RSV the most common virus detected (44%). The RSV-associated hospitalization rate was highest in children <6 months with an annual range of 21.1–25.9 per 1000, compared to 6.0–8.0 in 6–11-month-olds and 1.6–2.5 in 12–23-month-olds. RSV-positive children compared with RSV-negative were more likely to be previously healthy without underlying medical conditions, less likely to be born prematurely, had a higher frequency of supplemental oxygen use, and had lower median vitamin D levels. Risk factors for oxygen use in RSV-positive children included underlying medical conditions, lack of breastfeeding, younger age, and higher viral load.

To assess potential infectious disease risks to both obligate and facultative scavenger bird species, we performed a serosurvey for eleven potential pathogens in three species of scavenging birds in California: the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). California condors were seropositive for avian adenovirus, infectious bronchitis virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, avian paramyxovirus-2, West Nile virus (WNV) and Toxoplasma gondii. Golden eagles were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci and Toxoplasma gondii, and turkey vultures were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci, avian paramyxovirus-1, Toxoplasma gondii and WNV. Risk factor analyses indicated that rearing site and original release location were significantly associated with a positive serologic titer to WNV among free-flying condors.

Using a mouse model of viral hepatitis, we identified virus-induced early transcriptional changes in the redox pathways in the liver, including downregulation of superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1). Sod1(−/−) mice exhibited increased inflammation and aggravated liver damage upon viral infection, which was independent of T and NK cells and could be ameliorated by antioxidant treatment. Type I interferon (IFN-I) led to a downregulation of Sod1 and caused oxidative liver damage in Sod1(−/−) and wild-type mice. Genetic and pharmacological ablation of the IFN-I signaling pathway protected against virus-induced liver damage.

The respiratory effects of prolonged respirator use on pregnant women are unclear although there has been no definite evidence of harm from past use. METHODS: We conducted a two-phase controlled clinical study on healthy pregnant women between 27 to 32 weeks gestation. In phase I, energy expenditure corresponding to the workload of routine nursing tasks was determined. In phase II, pulmonary function of 20 subjects was measured whilst at rest and exercising to the predetermined workload while breathing ambient air first, then breathing through N95-mask materials. RESULTS: Exercising at 3 MET while breathing through N95-mask materials reduced mean tidal volume (TV) by 23.0 % (95 % CI −33.5 % to −10.5 %, p < 0.001) and lowered minute ventilation (VE) by 25.8 % (95 % CI −34.2 % to −15.8 %, p < 0.001), with no significant change in breathing frequency compared to breathing ambient air. Volumes of oxygen consumption (VO(2)) and carbon dioxide expired (VCO(2)) were also significantly reduced; VO(2) by 13.8 % (95 % CI −24.2 % to −3 %, p = 0.013) and VCO(2) by 17.7 %, (95 % CI −28.1 % to −8.6 %, p = 0.001). Although no changes in the inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations were demonstrated, breathing through N95-mask materials during low intensity work (3 MET) reduced expired oxygen concentration by 3.2 % (95 % CI: −4.1 % to −2.2 %, p < 0.001), and increased expired carbon dioxide by 8.9 % (95 % CI: 6.9 % to 13.1 %; p <0.001) suggesting an increase in metabolism. There were however no changes in the maternal and fetal heart rates, finger-tip capillary lactate levels and oxygen saturation and rating of perceived exertion at the work intensity investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Breathing through N95 mask materials have been shown to impede gaseous exchange and impose an additional workload on the metabolic system of pregnant healthcare workers, and this needs to be taken into consideration in guidelines for respirator use. The benefits of using N95 mask to prevent serious emerging infectious diseases should be weighed against potential respiratory consequences associated with extended N95 respirator usage.

Filovirus antivirals are currently not clinically available. Our findings suggest interferon gamma, an FDA-approved drug, may serve as a novel and effective prophylactic or treatment option. Using mouse-adapted Ebola virus, we found that murine interferon gamma administered 24 hours before or after infection robustly protects lethally-challenged mice and reduces morbidity and serum viral titers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that interferon gamma profoundly inhibits Ebola virus infection of macrophages, an early cellular target of infection. As early as six hours following in vitro infection, Ebola virus RNA levels in interferon gamma-treated macrophages were lower than in infected, untreated cells. Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to interferon gamma-treated macrophages did not further reduce viral RNA levels, suggesting that interferon gamma blocks life cycle events that require protein synthesis such as virus replication. Microarray studies with interferon gamma-treated human macrophages identified more than 160 interferon-stimulated genes. Ectopic expression of a select group of these genes inhibited Ebola virus infection. These studies provide new potential avenues for antiviral targeting as these genes that have not previously appreciated to inhibit negative strand RNA viruses and specifically Ebola virus infection. As treatment of interferon gamma robustly protects mice from lethal Ebola virus infection, we propose that interferon gamma should be further evaluated for its efficacy as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategy against filoviruses.

In pursuit of this strategy, most attention has been paid to electric cars. However, substantial, yet untapped, potentials could be realized in urban areas through the large-scale introduction of electric two-wheelers. Here, we review the environmental, economic, and social performance of electric two-wheelers, demonstrating that these are generally more energy efficient and less polluting than conventionally-powered motor vehicles. Electric two-wheelers tend to decrease exposure to pollution as their environmental impacts largely result from vehicle production and electricity generation outside of urban areas. Our analysis suggests that the price of e-bikes has been decreasing at a learning rate of 8%. Despite price differentials of 5000 ± 1800 EUR(2012) kW h(−1) in Europe, e-bikes are penetrating the market because they appear to offer an apparent additional use value relative to bicycles. Mid-size and large electric two-wheelers do not offer such an additional use value compared to their conventional counterparts and constitute niche products at price differentials of 700 ± 360 EUR(2012) kW(−1) and 160 ± 90 EUR(2012) kW(−1), respectively.

Unfortunately, the most potent adjuvants are often associated with toxicity and safety issues. Inulin, a plant-derived polysaccharide, has no immunological activity in its native soluble form but when crystallised into stable microparticles (delta inulin) acquires potent adjuvant activity. Delta inulin has been shown to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses against a broad range of co-administered viral, bacterial, parasitic and toxin antigens. Inulin normally crystallises as large heterogeneous particles with a broad size distribution and variable solubility temperatures. To ensure reproducible delta inulin particles with a consistent size distribution and temperature of solubility, a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) process was designed to produce Advax™ adjuvant.

As for Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities, the scarcity of land has always been assumed as a major impediment for its long-term development. Therefore, the Hong Kong government actively explores approaches to enhance usable land resources. One viable approach is rock cavern development. This paper presents a feasibility assessment of relocating a sewage treatment works to a cavern, with emphasis on the evaluation of environmental sustainability. Wind tunnel tests were carried out with efforts to estimate the prospective odor impact, as well as the wind availability at pedestrian level. It is noted that the sewage odor concentration depends greatly on the dispersion distance and the surrounding topography. The results indicate that when the sewage treatment works is relocated to the cavern, the predicted odor concentration will not cause damage to human health as long as the ventilation shaft is properly placed. In addition, the air ventilation assessments were conducted for both before/after the planned building development. It shows that the new building development at the current plant site will not significantly influence the wind availability at pedestrian level in the surrounding areas. This paper highlights the importance of sustainable development in connection with the environment, and shows that rock cavern development can be an attractive alternative for strategic urban planning in Hong Kong.",2015-10-31,"Shu,Z.R;He,Y.C;Li,Q.S.",JournalofWindEngineeringandIndustrialAerodynamics,107217977,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167610515001476;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610515001476,24qe0yn7,

We aimed to characterise the clinical and demographic features associated with different RV species detected in children attending hospital with ARI, from low-income families in North-east Brazil. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 630 children <5years with ARI. Clinical diagnosis and disease severity were also recorded. Samples were analysed by multiplex PCR for 18 viral and atypical bacterial pathogens; RV positive samples underwent partial sequencing to determine species and type. RESULTS: RV was the fourth commonest pathogen accounting for 18.7% of pathogens detected. RV was commonly detected in children with bronchiolitis, pneumonia and asthma/episodic viral wheeze (EVW). Species and type were assigned in 112 cases (73% RV-A; 27% RV-C; 0% RV-B). Generally, there were no differences in clinical or demographic characteristics between those infected with RV-A and RV-C. However, in children with asthma/EVW, RV-C was detected relatively more frequently than RV-A (23% vs 5%; p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight RV as a potentially important pathogen in this setting. Generally, clinical and demographic features were similar in children in whom RV A and C species were detected.

However, there is paucity of data from a large cohort, examining multiple biological specimens for diverse pathogens (bacteria and viruses). The Community Acquired Pneumonia Etiology Study (CAPES) was designed to address this knowledge gap. METHODS: We enrolled children with CAP (based on WHO IMCI criteria of tachypnea with cough or breathing difficulty) over 24 consecutive months, and recorded presenting symptoms, risk factors, clinical signs, and chest radiography. We performed blood and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) bacterial cultures, and serology (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae). We also performed multiplex PCR for 25 bacterial/viral species in a subgroup representing 20% of the cohort. Children requiring endotracheal intubation underwent culture and PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. FINDINGS: We enrolled 2345 children. NPA and blood cultures yielded bacteria in only 322 (13.7%) and 49 (2.1%) children respectively. In NPA, Streptococcus pneumoniae (79.1%) predominated, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (9.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.8%). In blood, S. aureus (30.6%) dominated, followed by S. pneumoniae (20.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.2%). M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae serology were positive in 4.3% and 1.1% respectively. Multiplex PCR in 428 NPA specimens identified organisms in 422 (98.6%); of these 352 (82.2%) had multiple organisms and only 70 (16.4%) had a single organism viz. S. pneumoniae: 35 (50%), Cytomegalovirus (CMV): 13 (18.6%), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV): 9 (12.9%), other viruses: 6 (8.7%), S. aureus: 5 (7.1%), and H. influenzae: 2 (2.9%). BAL PCR (n = 30) identified single pathogens in 10 (S. pneumoniae–3, CMV–3, S. aureus–2, H. influenzae–2) and multiple pathogens in 18 children. There were 108 (4.6%) deaths. The pattern of pathogens identified did not correlate with pneumonia severity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children with CAP have multiple pathogens (bacteria and viruses). S. pneumoniae and S. aureus predominate in NPA and blood respectively. CMV and RSV were the dominant respiratory viruses in NPA and BAL.

However, no information has been published regarding the minimum infectious dose (MID) of PEDV in different pig models. The main objective of this study was to determine the oral minimum infectious dose of PEDV in naïve conventional neonatal piglets and weaned pigs. A U.S. virulent PEDV prototype isolate (USA/IN19338/2013) with known infectious titer was serially ten-fold diluted in virus-negative cell culture medium. Dilutions with theoretical infectious titers from 560 to 0.0056 TCID(50)/ml together with a medium control were orogastrically inoculated (10ml/pig) into 7 groups of 5-day-old neonatal pigs (n = 4 per group) and 7 groups of 21-day-old weaned pigs (n = 6 per group). In 5-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum having titers 560–0.056 TCID(50)/ml, corresponding to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values 24.2–37.6, resulted in 100% infection in each group; 10ml of inoculum with titer 0.0056 TCID(50)/ml (Ct>45) caused infection in 25% of the inoculated pigs. In 21-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum with titers 560–5.6 TCID(50)/ml (Ct 24.2–31.4) resulted in 100% infection in each group while 10ml of inoculum with titers 0.56–0.0056 TCID(50)/ml (Ct values 35.3 –>45) did not establish infection in any pigs under study conditions as determined by clinical signs, PCR, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and antibody response. These data reveal that PEDV infectious dose is age-dependent with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results and when designing a PEDV bioassay model. The observation of such a low MID in neonates also emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms.",2015-10-06,"Thomas,JosephT.;Chen,Qi;Gauger,PhillipC.;Giménez-Lirola,LuisG.;Sinha,Avanti;Harmon,KarenM.;Madson,DarinM.;Burrough,EricR.;Magstadt,DrewR.;Salzbrenner,HollyM.;Welch,MichaelW.;Yoon,Kyoung-Jin;Zimmerman,JeffreyJ.;Zhang,Jianqiang",PLoSOne,16708221,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139266;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26441071/,1kjk404o,

CONCLUSION: We reported a very rare case of KD which suggests that the disease can be concurrent Coxsackievirus A4 infection. Although KD is an acute childhood disease, with fever as one of the principal features, KD should also be considered in the differential diagnosis when adult patients present with a fever of unknown cause associated with a rash.",2015-09-29,"Ueda,Yuki;Kenzaka,Tsuneaki;Noda,Ayako;Yamamoto,Yu;Matsumura,Masami",IntMedCaseRepJ,16958758,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.2147/imcrj.s90685;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26491373/,019lkt6k,

As a dipeptidase, it exerts its catalytic effects on proteins/peptides with proline, alanine, or serine in the penultimate (P1) amino acid residue from the amino terminus. The evidence to date supports an important effect of DPP4 in catalytic cleavage of incretin peptides and this perhaps represents the main mechanism by which DPP4 inhibition improves glycemic control. DPP4 also plays an important role in the degradation of multiple chemokines of which stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12) is perhaps an increasingly recognized target, given its importance in processes, such as hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and stem cell homing.

Serum was collected from healthy donors and patients diagnosed with dengue infection. RNA extracted from the serum samples were tested by reverse-transcription-LAMP assay developed based on 3′-NCR gene sequences for DENV 1–4. Results were interpreted by a turbidity meter in real time or visually at the end of the assay. Sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP results were calculated and compared to qRT-PCR and ELISA. RT-LAMP is highly sensitive with the detection limit of 10 RNA copies for all serotypes.

The recent nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals in Seoul, Korea and at the National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia indicate the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV. Currently there are no effective anti-MERS-CoV anti-viral agents or therapeutics and MERS is associated with a high mortality rate (40%) in hospitalised patients. A large proportion of MERS patients who die have a range of pulmonary pathology ranging from pneumonia to adult respiratory distress syndrome with multi-organ failure, compounded by co-morbidities, reflecting a precarious balance of interactions between the host-immune system and MERS-CoV. Whilst we wait for new MERS-CoV specific drugs, therapeutics and vaccines to be developed, there is a need to advance a range of Host-Directed Therapies. A range of HDTs are available, including commonly used drugs with good safety profiles, which could augment host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms to MERS-CoV, modulate excessive inflammation and reduce lung tissue destruction. We discuss the rationale and potential of using Host-Directed Therapies for improving the poor treatment outcomes associated with MERS. Carefully designed randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine whether HDTs could benefit patients with MERS.

Advances in diagnostic technologies such as respiratory panels (RP) utilizing polymerase chain reactions to detect viruses and determination of procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations may aid in this differentiation. However, some studies have shown limited impact for this purpose and thus continuation of antibiotics despite results suggesting viral infection. Our objective was to characterize clinician-prescribing behavior at our institution once RP and/or PCT results were known and suggestive of a viral respiratory infection. METHODS: This retrospective analysis was based upon records of hospitalized patients in whom proven or possible respiratory infections as indicated by RP testing, respiratory bacterial culture or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 9th revision codes for acute infectious respiratory illness was documented. Patients evaluated were required to have a RP or PCT within the first 72 h of presentation. Drug orders were evaluated for discontinuation of antibiotic therapy within 48 h of a procalcitonin of <0.25 μg/mL, a positive viral RP result, or both. RESULTS: Of 4869 patients with PCT and/or RP results, 2031 were included. PCT and RP testing were obtained in 503 and 1823 patients, respectively, with 295 patients having both. Results of these tests suggested 789 patients were potential candidates for antibiotic avoidance. These included 219 with a PCT <0.25 μg/mL, 601 with a positive viral RP result, and 31 with both. Antibiotics were administered to 307 patients (39%) within the first 72 h. In these, antibiotics were discontinued within 48 h of laboratory results availability. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that positive viral RP and low PCT results are infrequently associated with discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in proven or possible respiratory infections at our institution. Direct interventions with clinicians are likely needed to correct this behavior and decrease unnecessary antibiotic use.

As of 19 June 2015, a total of 1,338 MERS-CoV infections have been notified to the World Health Organization (WHO). Clinical illness associated with MERS-CoV ranges from mild upper respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive pneumonia and multi-organ failure. A significant proportion of patients present with non-respiratory symptoms such as headache, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhoea. A few potential therapeutic agents have been identified but none have been conclusively shown to be clinically effective. Human to human transmission is well documented, but the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV remains limited at present. Healthcare-associated clusters of MERS-CoV have been responsible for the majority of reported cases. The largest outbreaks have been driven by delayed diagnosis, overcrowding and poor infection control practices. However, chains of MERS-CoV transmission can be readily interrupted with implementation of appropriate control measures. As with any emerging infectious disease, guidelines for MERS-CoV case identification and surveillance evolved as new data became available. Sound clinical judgment is required to identify unusual presentations and trigger appropriate control precautions. Evidence from multiple sources implicates dromedary camels as natural hosts of MERS-CoV. Camel to human transmission has been demonstrated, but the exact mechanism of infection remains uncertain.

Vero cell, an African green monkey kidney cell line, was often used to isolate and propagate PEDV. Nonetheless, the target cells of PEDV in vivo are intestinal epithelial cells, during infection, intestinal epithelia would be damaged and resulted in digestive disorders. The immune functions of porcine epithelial cells and interactions with other immune cell populations display a number of differences compared to other species. Type I interferon (IFN) plays an important role in antiviral immune response. Limited reports showed that PEDV could inhibit type I interferon production. In this study, porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), the target cells of PEDV, were used as the infection model in vitro to identify the possible molecular mechanisms of PEDV-inhibition IFN-β production. RESULTS: PEDV not only failed to induce IFN-β expression, but also inhibited dsRNA-mediated IFN-β production in IECs. As the key IFN-β transcription factors, we found that dsRNA-induced activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) was inhibited after PEDV infection, but not nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). To identify the mechanism of PEDV intervention with dsRNA-mediated IFN-β expression more accurately, the role of individual molecules of RIG-I signaling pathway were investigated. In the upstream of IRF-3, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-or inhibitor of κB kinase-ε (IKKε)-mediated IFN-β production was not blocked by PEDV, while RIG-I-and its adapter molecule IFN-β promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1)-mediated IFN-β production were completely inhibited after PEDV infection. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data demonstrated for the first time that PEDV infection of its target cell line, IECs, inhibited dsRNA-mediated IFN-β production by blocking the activation of IPS-1 in RIG-I-mediated pathway.

CNS infection initiates a strong local immune response that fails to control the virus but is responsible for by-stander lesions involved in neurocognitive disorders. Although highly active anti-retroviral therapy now offers an almost complete control of CNS viral proliferation, low-grade CNS inflammation persists. This review focuses on HIV-induced intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis. Intrathecal Ig synthesis early occurs in more than three-quarters of patients in response to viral infection of the CNS and persists throughout the course of the disease. Viral antigens are targeted but this specific response accounts for < 5% of the whole intrathecal synthesis. Although the nature and mechanisms leading to non-specific synthesis are unknown, this prominent proportion is comparable to that observed in various CNS viral infections. Cerebrospinal fluid-floating antibody-secreting cells account for a minority of the whole synthesis, which mainly takes place in perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of the CNS parenchyma. B-cell traffic and lineage across the blood–brain-barrier have not yet been described. We review common technical pitfalls and update the pending questions in the field.

In many cases of community-acquired respiratory infections, clinicians treat patients empirically. The development of molecular methods for direct detection of viruses has been progressed recently. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was recognizing the panel of respiratory RNA viruses by multiplex SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized 172 influenza-negative respiratory specimens of all age groups of hospitalized patients were collected. After RNA extraction, cDNA was synthesized. Three SYBR Green multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed for simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory RNA viruses. Each set of multiplex methods detected four viruses, the first set: respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus; the second set: parainfluenza viruses 1 - 4 (PIV1-4); the third set: coronaviruses NL63, 229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and OC43. RESULTS: Application of the multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR in clinical samples from 172 patients in a one-year study resulted in detection of 19 (11.04%) PIV3, 9 (5.23%) PIV4, and 1 (0.58%) coronavirus NL63.

Poliovirus 3D(pol) uses template-dependent reiterative transcription mechanisms as it replicates the poly(A) tails of viral RNA (Steil et al., 2010). These mechanisms are analogous to those involved in the polyadenylation of vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus mRNAs. 3D(pol) residues intimately associated with viral RNA templates and products regulate the size of poly(A) tails in viral RNA (Kempf et al., 2013). Consistent with their ancient evolutionary origins, picornavirus 3D(pol) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) share structural and functional features. Structurally, both 3D(pol) and TERT assume a “right-hand” conformation with thumb, palm and fingers domains encircling templates and products. Functionally, both 3D(pol) and TERT use template-dependent reiterative transcription mechanisms to synthesize repetitive sequences: poly(A) tails in the case of picornavirus RNA genomes and DNA telomeres in the case of eukaryotic chromosomes.

OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to establish the use of rolling circle amplification (RCA) based on internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) as a powerful, simple, and rapid procedure for distinguishing closely related organisms, and specifically to identify Trichophyton species, which cause human and animal disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of sixty-one isolates belonging to three species of Trichophyton were identified to the species level based on microscopic and macroscopic examinations and their ITS rDNA regions were sequenced. Three specific circular oligonucleotide probes targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions were designed to differentiate Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and T. tonsurans. RESULTS: Of the 61 putative Trichophyton clinical isolates, 52 were identified to the species level. The most common species was T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale (31 isolates), followed by T. rubrum (11 isolates), T. tonsurans (9 isolates), and T. violaceum (1 isolates); moreover, 9 isolates were identified as non-Trichophyton species. The RCA method correctly identified four Trichophyton species and was 100% specific for each species. Neither cross-reaction between the examined species of Trichophyton nor false positive or false negative results were observed.

Computational docking studies indicated that in all binding poses ATA binds in the YopH active site. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that in the predicted binding pose, ATA binds to the essential Cys403 and Arg409 residues in the active site and has a stronger binding affinity than the natural substrate (pTyr). The cyclic voltammetry experiments suggest that ATA reacts remarkably strongly with molecular oxygen. Additionally, the electrochemical reduction of ATA in the presence of a negative potential from −2.0 to 2.5 V generates a current signal, which is observed for hydrogen peroxide.

All these models, in a complementary way, have allowed to reach a good knowledge of the pathogenesis of MS. Specifically, EAE is the model which better reflects the autoimmune pathogenesis of MS and is extremely useful to study potential experimental treatments.

During the first half of the 20th century, microbiological quality control of lab animals was at best rudimentary as colonies were conventionally housed and little or no diagnostic testing was done. Hence, animal studies were often curtailed and confounded by infectious disease (Mobraaten and Sharp, 1999; Morse, 2007; Weisbroth, 1999). By the 1950s, it became apparent to veterinarians in the nascent field of comparative medicine that disease-free animals suitable for research could not be produced by standard veterinary disease control measures (e.g., improved sanitation and nutrition, antimicrobial treatments) in conventional facilities. Henry Foster, the veterinarian who founded Charles River Breeding Laboratories in 1948 and a pioneer in the large-scale production of laboratory rodents, stated in a seminar presented at the 30th anniversary of AALAS, “After a variety of frustrating health-related problems, it was decided that a major change in the company’s philosophy was required and an entirely different approach was essential”. Consequently, he and others developed innovative biosecurity systems to eliminate and exclude pathogens (Allen, 1999). In 1958, Foster reported on the Cesarean-originated barrier-sustained (COBS) process for the large-scale production of specific pathogen-free (SPF) laboratory rodents (Foster, 1958). To eliminate horizontally transmitted pathogens, a hysterectomy was performed on a near-term dam from a contaminated or conventionally housed colony. The gravid uterus was pulled through a disinfectant solution into a sterile flexible film isolator where the pups were removed from the uterus and suckled on axenic (i.e., germ-free) foster dams. After being mated to expand their number and associated with a cocktail of nonpathogenic bacteria to normalize their physiology and prime their immune system, rederived rodents were transferred to so-called barrier rooms for large-scale production. The room-level barrier to adventitious infection entailed disinfection of the room, equipment, and supplies, limiting access to trained and properly gowned personnel, and the application of new technologies such as high-efficiency particulate air-filtration of incoming air (Dubos and Schaedler, 1960; Foster, 1980; Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983; Trexler and Orcutt, 1999). The axenic and associated rodents mentioned in the COBS process are collectively classified as gnotobiotic to indicate that they have a completely known microflora. By contrast, barrier-reared rodent colonies are not gnotobiotic because they are housed in uncovered cages and thus acquire a complex microflora from the environment, supplies, personnel, and other sources. Instead, they are described as SPF to indicate that according to laboratory testing, they are free from infection with a defined list of infectious agents, commonly known as an ‘exclusion’ list.",2015-07-10,"Shek,WilliamR.;Smith,AbigailL.;Pritchett-Corning,KathleenR.",LaboratoryAnimalMedicine,88685732,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124095274000110;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095274000110,27unytp6,

However, the passage of staff through isolation room doors is suspected to be a cause of containment failure, especially in case of hinged doors. It is therefore important to minimize inadvertent contaminant airflow leakage across the doorway during such movements. To this end, it is essential to investigate the behavior of such airflows, especially the overall volume of air that can potentially leak across the doorway during door-opening and human passage. Experimental measurements using full-scale mock-ups are expensive and labour intensive. A useful alternative approach is the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling using a time-resolved Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method. In this study simulated air flow patterns are qualitatively compared with experimental ones, and the simulated total volume of air that escapes is compared with the experimentally measured volume. It is shown that the LES method is able to reproduce, at room scale, the complex transient airflows generated during door-opening/closing motions and the passage of a human figure through the doorway between two rooms. This was a basic test case that was performed in an isothermal environment without ventilation. However, the advantage of the CFD approach is that the addition of ventilation airflows and a temperature difference between the rooms is, in principle, a relatively simple task. A standard method to observe flow structures is dosing smoke into the flow. In this paper we introduce graphical methods to simulate smoke experiments by LES, making it very easy to compare the CFD simulation to the experiments. The results demonstrate that the transient CFD simulation is a promising tool to compare different isolation room scenarios without the need to construct full-scale experimental models. The CFD model is able to reproduce the complex airflows and estimate the volume of air escaping as a function of time. In this test, the calculated migrated air volume in the CFD model differed by 20% from the experimental tracer gas measurements. In the case containing only a hinged door operation, without passage, the difference was only 10%.",2015-07-07,"Saarinen,PekkaE.;Kalliomäki,Petri;Tang,JulianW.;Koskela,Hannu",PLoSOne,18668905,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151865/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130667,15oi1wza,

Structural information relating to p7 from multiple genotypes has been generated in silico (e.g. genotype (GT) 1a), as well as obtained from experiments in form of monomeric and hexameric structures (GTs 1b and 5a, respectively). However, sequence diversity and structural differences mean that comparison of their channel gating behaviour has not thus far been simulated. Here, a molecular model of the monomeric GT 1a protein is optimized and assembled into a hexameric bundle for comparison with both the 5a hexamer structure and another hexameric bundle generated using the GT 1b monomer structure.

To date, no pooled data on the accessibility, technical specifications and operational procedures for such transport capacities are available. During 2009, the ‘European Network for HIDs’ conducted a cross-sectional analysis of hospitals responsible for HID patients in Europe including an assessment of (a) legal aspects; (b) technical and infrastructure aspects; and (c) operational procedures for ground ambulances used for HID transport.

Despite the use of a neuron-specific promoter to generate the Tg mice, they expressed significant levels of H-apoD in both plasma and liver and they slowly develop hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We show here that hepatic PPARγ expression in Tg mice is increased by 2-fold compared to wild type (WT) mice. Consequently, PPARγ target genes Plin2 and Cide A/C are overexpressed, leading to increased lipid droplets formation. Expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36, another PPARgamma target, is also increased in Tg mice associated with elevated fatty acid uptake as measured in primary hepatocytes. Elevated expression of AMPK in the liver of Tg leads to phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, indicating a decreased activity of the enzyme. Fatty acid synthase expression is also induced but the hepatic lipogenesis measured in vivo is not significantly different between WT and Tg mice. In addition, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, is slightly upregulated. Finally, we show that overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in presence of arachidonic acid (AA), the main apoD ligand, increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Supporting the role of apoD in AA transport, we observed enrichment in hepatic AA and a decrease in plasmatic AA concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hepatic steatosis observed in apoD Tg mice is a consequence of increased PPARγ transcriptional activity by AA leading to increased fatty acid uptake by the liver.",2015-06-17,"Labrie,Marilyne;Lalonde,Simon;Najyb,Ouafa;Thiery,Maxime;Daneault,Caroline;DesRosiers,Chrisitne;Rassart,Eric;Mounier,Catherine",PLoSOne,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470830/,0wtq1c15,

We then computed a pooled odds ratio and virus–specific attributable fraction among the exposed of 8 common viruses – respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (IFV), parainfluenza (PIV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RV), bocavirus (BoV), and coronavirus (CoV).

Popular targets for this therapy have been sequences encoding viral proteins and cellular host factors on which viruses depend for their replication. Therefore, availability of technologies that inactivate genes specifically, safely and effectively is crucial. Hence, discovery of RNA interference and advances in gene editing methods have been particularly important to the field. Gene transfer to induce prophylactic and therapeutic immunostimulation is also being developed to manage viral infections. Although promising, progress and ultimate success of antiviral gene therapy is dependent on several factors. These include overcoming problems that are generic to the field and influences of elements that are particular to specific viral infections. Viral and nonviral vectors (NVVs) have been used to deliver antiviral sequences, and both have advantages and drawbacks. Viral vectors are suited to delivering DNA-based expression cassettes, including immunostimulatory and virus-targeting sequences, whereas NVVs may be better applied to carrying therapeutic RNAs such as synthetic short interfering RNAs or mRNAs. Nonviral formulations are appealing because they cause limited immunostimulation, obviate mutagenic effects of DNA, and are amenable to easier dose control and large-scale synthesis. To date, encouraging results have been obtained in preclinical and clinical assessments of gene therapy against HIV-1, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and Ebola viruses, among others. In the long term, widespread application of antiviral gene therapy will be dependent on the technology demonstrating good efficacy and advantages over other antiviral strategies.

We have previously shown that children with chronic suppurative lung disease have a reduced capacity to produce IFN-γ in response to NTHi compared with healthy control children. The aim of this study was to determine if deficient NTHi-specific IFN-γ production is associated with heightened systemic or airway inflammation. We measured a panel of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p70), antimicrobial proteins (LL-37, IP-10) as well as cellular and clinical factors associated with airway and systemic inflammation in 70 children with chronic suppurative lung disease. IFN-γ was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells challenged in vitro with live NTHi. Regression analysis was used to assess the association between the systemic and airway inflammation and the capacity to produce IFN-γ. On multivariate regression, NTHi-specific IFN-γ production was significantly negatively associated with the BAL concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (β=-0.316; 95%CI -0.49, -0.14; p=0.001) and IL-1β (β=-0.023; 95%CI -0.04, -0.01; p=0.001). This association was independent of bacterial or viral infection, BAL cellularity and the severity of bronchiectasis (using modified Bhalla score on chest CT scans). We found limited evidence of systemic inflammation in children with chronic suppurative lung disease. In summary, increased local airway inflammation is associated with a poorer systemic cell-mediated immune response to NTHi in children with chronic suppurative lung disease. These data support the emerging body of evidence that impaired cell-mediated immune responses and dysregulated airway inflammation may be linked and contribute to the pathobiology of chronic suppurative lung disease.",2015-06-12,"Pizzutto,SusanJ.;Upham,JohnW.;Yerkovich,StephanieT.;Chang,AnneB.",PLoSOne,32297122,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26066058/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129517,19jo817j,

Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai extract (SQE) inhibits PRRSV infection in cultured porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Our results demonstrated that SQE treatment suppressed the replication of PRRSV in a dose-dependent manner. The antiviral activity of SQE on PRRSV replication was found to be primarily exerted at early times postinfection. Treatment with SQE resulted in marked reduction of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny virus production. Notably, pro-inflammatory cytokine production in PAM cells infected with PRRSV was shown to be modulated in the presence of SQE.

As with all animal production systems, it is subject to the risk of outbreak of transboundary diseases. In the present overview, evaluations of the perceived risk of selected transboundary animal diseases of pigs, as collated from the willing participants from the provincial veterinary services of South Africa, are presented. A scenario tree revealed that infected but undetected pigs were the greatest perceived threat. The provincial veterinary services, according to participants in the study, face certain difficulties, including the reporting of disease and the flow of disease information amongst farmers. Perceived strengths in surveillance and disease monitoring include the swiftness of sample despatch to the national testing laboratory, as well as the ease of flow of information between the provincial and national agricultural authorities. The four factors were identified that were perceived to most influence animal health-service delivery: transport, access, livestock policy and resources. African swine fever was perceived to be the most important pig disease in South Africa. Because the decentralisation of veterinary services in South Africa was identified as a potential weakness, it is recommended that national and provincial veterinary services need to work together and interdependently to achieve centrally controlled surveillance systems.

Most courses have been developed in high-income countries. However, whether these courses improve the ability of health professionals to provide appropriate care in low-income countries remains unclear. This is the first update of the original review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of in-service emergency care training on health professionals' treatment of seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, part of The Cochrane Library (http://www.cochranelibrary.com); MEDLINE, Ovid SP; EMBASE, Ovid SP; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of The Cochrane Library (http://www.cochranelibrary.com) (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge/Science and eight other databases. We performed database searches in February 2015. We also searched clinical trial registries, websites of relevant organisations and reference lists of related reviews. We applied no date, language or publication status restrictions when conducting the searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted-time-series studies that compared the effects of in-service emergency care training versus usual care were eligible for inclusion. We included only hospital-based studies and excluded community-based studies. Two review authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study risk of bias and confidence in effect estimates (certainty of evidence) for each outcome using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). We described results and presented them in GRADE tables. MAIN RESULTS: We identified no new studies in this update. Two randomised trials (which were included in the original review) met the review eligibility criteria. In the first trial, newborn resuscitation training compared with usual care improved provider performance of appropriate resuscitation (trained 66% vs usual care 27%, risk ratio 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 3.42; moderate certainty evidence) and reduced inappropriate resuscitation (trained mean 0.53 vs usual care 0.92, mean difference 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.66; moderate certainty evidence). Effect on neonatal mortality was inconclusive (trained 28% vs usual care 25%, risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.48; N = 27 deaths; low certainty evidence). Findings from the second trial suggest that essential newborn care training compared with usual care probably slightly improves delivery room newborn care practices (assessment of breathing, preparedness for resuscitation) (moderate certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In-service neonatal emergency care courses probably improve health professionals' treatment of seriously ill babies in the short term. Further multi-centre randomised trials evaluating the effects of in-service emergency care training on long-term outcomes (health professional practice and patient outcomes) are needed.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of CSFV to induce viral persistence upon early postnatal infection. Two litters of 10 piglets each were infected intranasally on the day of birth with low and moderate virulence CSFV isolates, respectively. During six weeks after postnatal infection, most of the piglets remained clinically healthy, despite persistent high virus titres in the serum. Importantly, these animals were unable to mount any detectable humoral and cellular immune response. At necropsy, the most prominent gross pathological lesion was a severe thymus atrophy. Four weeks after infection, PBMCs from the persistently infected seronegative piglets were unresponsive to both, specific CSFV and non-specific PHA stimulation in terms of IFN-γ-producing cells. These results suggested the development of a state of immunosuppression in these postnatally persistently infected pigs. However, IL-10 was undetectable in the sera of the persistently infected animals. Interestingly, CSFV-stimulated PBMCs from the persistently infected piglets produced IL-10. Nevertheless, despite the addition of the anti-IL-10 antibody in the PBMC culture from persistently infected piglets, the response of the IFN-γ producing cells was not restored. Therefore, other factors than IL-10 may be involved in the general suppression of the T-cell responses upon CSFV and mitogen activation. Interestingly, bone marrow immature granulocytes were increased and targeted by the virus in persistently infected piglets.

The high degree of homology within the protease’s active site and substrate conservation supports the identification of broad spectrum lead compounds. A previous study identified the compound ML188, also termed 16R, as an inhibitor of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CL(pro). This study will detail the generation of a homology model of the 3CL(pro) of the human coronavirus OC43 and determine the potential of 16R to form a broad-spectrum lead compound. MODELLER was used to generate a suitable three-dimensional model of the OC43 3CL(pro) and the Prime module of Schrӧdinger predicted the binding conformation and free energy of binding of 16R within the 3CL(pro) active site. Molecular dynamics further confirmed ligand stability and hydrogen bonding networks. RESULTS: A high quality homology model of the OC43 3CL(pro) was successfully generated in an active conformation. Further studies reproduced the binding pose of 16R within the active site of the generated model, where its free energy of binding was shown to equal that of the 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV, a receptor it is experimentally proven to inhibit. The stability of the ligand was subsequently confirmed by molecular dynamics. CONCLUSION: The lead compound 16R may represent a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the 3CL(pro) of OC43 and potentially other coronaviruses. This study provides an atomistic structure of the 3CL(pro) of OC43 and supports further experimental validation of the inhibitory effects of 16R.

The outbreak of this new influenza virus highlighted the need for the development of universal influenza vaccines. Previously, we demonstrated that a tetrameric peptide vaccine based on the matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) of the H5N1 virus (H5N1-M2e) could protect mice from lethal infection with different clades of H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses. In this study, we investigated the cross-protection of H5N1-M2e against lethal infection with the new H7N9 virus. Although five amino acid differences existed at positions 13, 14, 18, 20, and 21 between M2e of H5N1 and H7N9, H5N1-M2e vaccination with either Freund's adjuvant or the Sigma adjuvant system (SAS) induced a high level of anti-M2e antibody, which cross-reacted with H7N9-M2e peptide. A mouse-adapted H7N9 strain, A/Anhui/01/2013m, was used for lethal challenge in animal experiments. H5N1-M2e vaccination provided potent cross-protection against lethal challenge of the H7N9 virus.

Our results suggest that the tetrameric H5N1-M2e peptide vaccine could protect against different subtypes of influenza virus infections.

This implies significant slippage occurs when the intercodon is in the (perhaps distorted) ribosomal A site. We accommodate the influence of the intercodon in a model of frame maintenance versus frameshifting in HIV-1.",2015-03-25,"Mathew,SuneethF.;Crowe-McAuliffe,Caillan;Graves,Ryan;Cardno,TonyS.;McKinney,Cushla;Poole,ElizabethS.;Tate,WarrenP.",PLoSOne,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373837/,10p3mth2,

Chemokines, which are known to play a role in inflammation, are also involved in the remyelination process. We aimed to demonstrate that remyelination-stimulating factors are altered in the brainstem of 1- and 6-month-old taiep rats. We used a Rat RT(2) Profiler PCR Array to assess mRNA expression of 84 genes coding for cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors. We also evaluated protein levels of CCL2, CCR1, CCR2, CCL5, CCR5, CCR8, CXCL1, CXCR2, CXCR4, FGF2, and VEGFA by ELISA. Sprague-Dawley rats were used as a control. PCR Array procedure showed that proinflammatory cytokines were not upregulated in the taiep rat. In contrast, some mRNA levels of beta and alpha chemokines were upregulated in 1-month-old rats, but CXCR4 was downregulated at their 6 months of age. ELISA results showed that CXCL1, CCL2, CCR2, CCR5, CCR8, and CXCR4 protein levels were decreased in brainstem at the age of 6 months.

ProLinker™ B enables antibodies to be attached to a gold-coated quartz surface in a regular pattern and in the correct orientation for antigen binding. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to set a cut-off value using reference CPVs (two groups: one CPV-positive and one CPV-negative). The ROC curves overlapped and the point of intersection was used as the cut-off value. A QCM biosensor with a cut-off value of −205 Hz showed 95.4% (104/109) sensitivity and 98.0% (149/152) specificity when used to test 261 field fecal samples compared to PCR.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Virus was applied to the hands of volunteers and sampled by the glove juice method with 1.5% beef extract (BE), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.01 and 0.1% Tween 80, tryptic soy broth (TSB), and 9% NaCl. Each volunteer underwent multiple rounds application and hand sampling. Mean log(10) virus loss across trials was 2.6 for BE, 2.8 for PBS, 2.4 for TSB, 3.8 for NaCl, 3.0 for 0.1% Tween 80, and 2.9 for 0.01% Tween 80. Within each volunteer, there was a decline in viral loss from the first to last trial. CONCLUSIONS: These eluents can recover Φ6 from hands with ~2-3 log(10) loss, comparable to recoveries previously reported for influenza. Protein and detergent-based eluents may have similar recoveries, but recovery may still vary across repeated sampling.

Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were used to compare the qPCR assay with standard microbiological methods. The limit of detection was 5 to 20 DNA template copies with approximately 1000-fold differences in concentrations of the two competing templates. SDs for positive controls were <5%.

The contract service aimed to convert village doctors, who had privately practiced for decades, into general practitioners under the government management, and better control the rampant chronic diseases. This study made a rare attempt to assess the effectiveness of public health services delivered under the contract service policy, explore the influencing mechanism and draw the implications for the policy extension in the future. METHODS: Three pilot counties and a non-pilot one with heterogeneity in economic and health development from east to west of China were selected by a purposive sampling method. The case study methods by document collection, non-participant observation and interviews (including key informant interview and focus group interview) with 84 health providers and 20 demanders in multiple level were applied in this study. A thematic approach was used to compare diverse outcomes and analyze mechanism in the complex adaptive systems framework. RESULTS: Without sufficient incentives, the public health services were not conducted effectively, regardless of the implementation of the contract policy. To appropriately increase the funding for public health by local finance and properly allocate subsidy to village doctors was one of the most effective approaches to stimulate health providers and demanders’ positivity and promote the policy implementation. County health bureaus acted as the most crucial agents among the complex public health systems. Their mental models influenced by the compound and various environments around them led to the diverse outcomes. If they could provide extra incentives and make the contexts of the systems ripe enough for change, the health providers and demanders would be receptive to the transition of the policy.

This current review evaluates if drainage systems can cause infections and thus be of clinical concern. METHOD: A review of the literature was analyzed. Papers, guidelines, and quality management systems have been considered. RESULTS: Adequate sanitation is fundamental and a prerequisite for safe life and productivity. In contrast, malfunctioning sanitation has been reported to cause outbreaks all over the world. In areas with no sanitation, diarrheal mortality is high and has been shown to decrease by 36% after interventions to improve sanitation. Often, infections are faeces associated and when present in wastewater and sewage sludge poses a high risk of infection upon exposure. Hence, there are working safety guidelines and in industries where infection reduction is essential strict quality assurance systems, i.e. HACCP (hazard analysis critical control points) and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) must be complied. Healthcare has recently taken interest in the HACCP system in their efforts to reduce healthcare associated infections as a response to increasing number of ineffective antibiotics and the threat of mortality rate like the pre-antibiotic era. The last few years have called for immediate action to contain the emergence of increasing resistant microorganisms. Resistance is obtained as a result of overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both healthcare and agriculture. Also, by the discharge of antibiotics from manufacturers, healthcare and society. One mechanism of development of novel resistant pathogens has been shown to be by effortless sharing of genetic mobile elements coding for resistance from microbes in the environment to human microbes. These pathogens have been sampled from the drainage systems. These were noticed owing to their possession of an unusual antibiotic resistance profile linking them to the outbreak. Often the cause of sanitation related outbreaks is due to inadequate sanitation and maintenance. However, in general these infections probably go unnoticed.

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of Kawasaki disease in acute stages in Taiwan, by linking the diagnosis code to medication and comparing the differences in epidemiological features with those of previous reports that used the diagnosis code alone. METHODS: We searched the National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2010. For the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) set, all inpatients with a main diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (ICD-9, 446.1) were retrieved. For the ICD-9 + intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) set, Kawasaki disease in acute stages was defined as the disease stages requiring IVIG. The epidemiologic features were calculated and compared by both methods. RESULTS: The incidence rates for children under 5 years ranged from 21.5 to 68.5 per 100,000 person-years (average 49.1) for the ICD-9 + IVIG set and from 48.5 to 82.8 per 100,000 person-years (average 74.9) for the ICD-9 set. Significant discrepancy in peak season estimation occurred in summer. The 5-year recurrence rate was 1.1% for the ICD-9 + IVIG set and 4.5% for the ICD-9 set. The coronary complication rates were around 7.24% (ICD-9 + IVIG) and 6.48% (ICD-9). CONCLUSION: Discrepancies occurred when different case definitions were used in claims data analysis.

The disease presents as severe respiratory infection often with shock, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. Recently, we observed three cases who presented with neurologic symptoms. These are so far the first reported cases of neurologic injury associated with MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected from three patients admitted with MERS-CoV infection to Intensive Care unit (ICU) at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. They were managed separately in three different wards prior to their admission to ICU. FINDING: The three patients presented with severe neurologic syndrome which included altered level of consciousness ranging from confusion to coma, ataxia, and focal motor deficit. Brain MRI revealed striking changes characterized by widespread, bilateral hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging within the white matter and subcortical areas of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. None of the lesions showed gadolinium enhancement. INTERPRETATION: CNS involvement should be considered in patients with MERS-CoV and progressive neurological disease, and further elucidation of the pathophysiology of this virus is needed.

The model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the disease-free and a unique endemic equilibrium. The existence and local stability of the disease free and endemic equilibria are explored in terms of the effective reproduction number R C . It is observed that media coverage does not affect the effective reproduction number, but it helps to mitigate disease burden by lowering the number of infectious individuals at the endemic steady state and also lowering the infection peak. A new approach is proposed to estimate the coefficient of media coverage. Using the results of central manifold theory, it is established that as R C passes through unity, transcritical bifurcation occurs in the system and the unique endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable. It is observed that the population level impact of quarantine and isolation depend on the level of transmission by the isolated individuals. Moreover, the higher level of pre-existing immunity in the population decreases the infection peak and causes its early arrival. Theoretical findings are supported by numerical simulation.

Viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronavirus (SARS hCoV), have co-opted Ub-ISG15 conjugation pathways for their own advantage or have evolved effector proteins to counter pro-inflammatory properties of Ub-ISG15-conjugated host proteins. In the present study, we compare substrate specificities of the papain-like protease (PLpro) from the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) hCoV to the related protease from SARS, SARS PLpro. Through biochemical assays, we show that, similar to SARS PLpro, MERS PLpro is both a deubiquitinating (DUB) and a deISGylating enzyme. Further analysis of the intrinsic DUB activity of these viral proteases revealed unique differences between the recognition and cleavage specificities of polyUb chains. First, MERS PLpro shows broad linkage specificity for the cleavage of polyUb chains, whereas SARS PLpro prefers to cleave Lys48-linked polyUb chains. Secondly, MERS PLpro cleaves polyUb chains in a 'mono-distributive' manner (one Ub at a time) and SARS PLpro prefers to cleave Lys48-linked polyUb chains by sensing a di-Ub moiety as a minimal recognition element using a 'di-distributive' cleavage mechanism. The di-distributive cleavage mechanism for SARS PLpro appears to be uncommon among USP (Ub-specific protease)-family DUBs, as related USP family members from humans do not display such a mechanism.

As of May 9, 2014, 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally. Methods Review of publicly available data about MERS-CoV health care–associated transmission. Results We identified 11 events of possible or confirmed health care–associated transmission with high morbidity and mortality, mainly among patients with comorbidities. Health care workers are also frequently affected; however, they tend to have milder symptoms and better prognosis. Gaps in infection control were noted in all events. Currently, health care–associated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusion There is a need to increase infection control capacity in affected areas and areas at increased risk of being affected to prevent transmission in health care settings. Vaccines and antiviral agents are urgently needed. Overall, our knowledge about the epidemiologic characteristics of MERS-CoV that impact health care transmission is very limited. As the MERS-CoV epidemic continues to evolve, issues concerning best infection control measures will arise, and studies to better define their effectiveness in real life are needed.",2014-12-31,"Maltezou,HelenaC.;Tsiodras,Sotirios",AmericanJournalofInfectionControl,24952155,True,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2014.06.019;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465253/;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655314009316;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655314009316,08a1oin2,

Clinical features of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) include atypical pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure that is highly reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV. The host response is a key component of highly pathogenic respiratory virus infection. Here, we computationally analyzed gene expression changes in a human airway epithelial cell line infected with two genetically distinct MERS-CoV strains obtained from human patients, MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1. RESULTS: Using topological techniques, including persistence homology and filtered clustering, we performed a comparative transcriptional analysis of human Calu-3 cell host responses to the different MERS-CoV strains, with MERS-CoV Eng 1 inducing early kinetic changes, between 3 and 12 hours post infection, compared to MERS-CoV SA 1. Robust transcriptional changes distinguished the two MERS-CoV strains predominantly at the late time points. Combining statistical analysis of infection and cytokine-stimulated Calu-3 transcriptomics, we identified differential innate responses, including up-regulation of extracellular remodeling genes following MERS-CoV Eng 1 infection and differential pro-inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: Through our genomics-based approach, we found topological differences in the kinetics and magnitude of the host response to MERS-CoV SA 1 and MERS-CoV Eng 1, with differential expression of innate immune and pro-inflammatory responsive genes as a result of IFN, TNF and IL-1α signaling. Predicted activation for STAT3 mediating gene expression relevant for epithelial cell-to-cell adherens and junction signaling in MERS-CoV Eng 1 infection suggest that these transcriptional differences may be the result of amino acid differences in viral proteins known to modulate innate immunity during MERS-CoV infection.

Limited information about T. gondii infection in bats is available in China. The objective of the present study was to determine prevalence and genetic characterization of T. gondii infection in bats in Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces, China. METHODS: During May 2005 to August 2013, bats were sampled from Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, China, and liver tissues were collected for the detection of T. gondii by a nested PCR targeting the B1 gene. The positive samples were genotyped at 11 genetic markers (SAG1, 5′-and 3′-SAG2, alternative SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, L358, PK1, c22-8, c29-2, and Apico) using multilocus polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: A total of 626 bats representing 10 species were examined for T. gondii infection, 38 (6.1%) were tested positive with by PCR, 8 positive DNA samples were completely genotyped, of which 3 samples (2 from Cynopterus sphinx, and 1 from Murina leucogaster) represented ToxoDB#10, and 5 samples (2 from Murina leucogaster, 2 from Myotis chinensis, and 1 from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) belonged to ToxoDB#9 (http://toxodb.org/toxo/).

There was a high prevalence of IAV, comprising of 27 subtype combinations, while APMV-1 had a comparatively low prevalence (with a peak of 2%) and limited strain variation, similar to previous findings. Avian CoVs were common, with prevalence up to 12%, and sequence analysis identified different putative genetic lineages.

The expanded model informed a new study approach to document the extent of human exposure to animals and explore the interplay of social and environmental factors that influence risk of transmission at the individual and community level. The approach includes a formative phase using qualitative and participatory methods, and a representative, random sample survey to quantify exposure to animals in a variety of settings. The paper discusses the different factors that were considered in developing the approach, including the range of animals asked about and the parameters of exposure that are included, as well as factors to be considered in local adaptation of the generic instruments. Illustrative results from research using this approach in Lao PDR are presented to demonstrate the effect of social factors on how people interact with animals. We believe that the expanded model can be similarly operationalized to explore the interactions of other social and policy-level determinants that may influence transmission of zoonoses.",2014-11-01,"Woldehanna,Sara;Zimicki,Susan",SocSciMed,36892738,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614007199;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.10.059;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953614007199;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464873/,1ldynibm,

The large amount of data generated provides an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively interpret potentially complex metagenomic mixtures. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. This interpretation problem can be formulated statistically as a mixture model, where the species of origin of each read is missing, but the complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the individual reads assignment. Several analytical tools have been proposed to approximately solve this computational problem. Here, we show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. The added accuracy comes at a cost of increased computation time. Our approach is useful for solving complex mixtures involving several related species. We designed our method specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets and with a particular focus on viral pathogen detection, but the principles are applicable more generally to all types of metagenomics mixtures.

The selection of aerosol delivery system for hospitalized children can have a significant impact on the utilization of healthcare resources. DESIGN AND SETTING: A quality improvement project to evaluate the impact of conversion to MDI-spacer to administer bronchodilators (BDs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) to hospitalized children on the utilization of hospital resources. The project was conducted in a tertiary pediatric ward from April to May 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The project was conducted over a six-week period. In the first two weeks, data were gathered from all hospitalized children receiving BDs and/or ICSs by nebulizers. This data collection was followed by a two-week washout period during which training of healthcare providers and operational changes were implemented to enhance the conversion to MDI-spacer. In the last two weeks, data were gathered from hospitalized children after conversion to MDI-spacer. The primary outcomes included the mean time (in minutes) of medication preparation and delivery. Secondary outcomes included the following: need for respiratory therapy assistance, estimated cost of treatment sessions, and patient/caregiver satisfaction. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-five treatment sessions were enrolled (288 on nebulizers, 287 on MDI-spacer). The nebulizer group had more male predominance and were slightly older compared to the MDI-spacer group (male: 59% vs. 53% and mean age: 52 vs. 40 months respectively). The duration of treatment preparation and delivery was significantly lower in the MDI-spacer group (2 min reduction in preparation time and 5 min reduction in delivery time; p < 0.01). Caregivers mastered MDI-spacer use after an average of two observed sessions, eliminating the need for respiratory therapy assistance during the hospital stay. Medication cost analysis showed savings in favor of MDI-spacer (cost reduction per 100 doses: 50% for albuterol, 30% for ipratropium bromide, and 87% for ICSs). The patient satisfaction survey showed “very good” to “excellent” levels in both groups.

However, some patients developed severe lower-respiratory tract infections with fatal consequences, and the cause of these infections remain unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that different populations have different degrees of susceptibility to pH1N1 strains due to host genetic variations that are associated with inappropriate immune responses against viral genetic characteristics. Here, we tested whether the pathologic patterns of influenza strains that produce different disease outcomes in humans could be reproduced in a ferret model. Our results revealed that the severities of infection did not correspond to particular viral isolate and were not associated with the clinical phenotypes of the corresponding patients. Severe pathological outcomes were associated with higher viral replication, especially in alveolar areas, and with an exacerbated innate cellular immune response that was characterised by substantial phagocytic and cytotoxic cell migration into the lungs. Moreover, detrimental innate cellular responses were linked to the up-regulation of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the down-regulation of IFNα in the lungs. Additionally, severe lung lesions were associated with greater up-regulations of pro-apoptotic markers and higher levels of apoptotic neutrophils and macrophages. In conclusion, this study confirmed that the clinicopathological outcomes of pH1N1 infection in ferrets were not only due to viral replication abilities but also depended on the hosts’ capacities to mount efficient immune responses to control viral infection of the lung.

There are five ebolavirus species; although much is known about Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) and its neutralization by antibodies, little is known about Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), which is emerging with increasing frequency. Here we describe monoclonal antibodies containing a human framework that potently inhibit infection by SUDV and protect mice from lethal challenge. The murine antibody 16F6, which binds the SUDV envelope glycoprotein (GP), served as the starting point for design. Sequence and structural alignment revealed similarities between 16F6 and YADS1, a synthetic antibody with a humanized scaffold. A focused phage library was constructed and screened to impart 16F6-like recognition properties onto the YADS1 scaffold. A panel of 17 antibodies were characterized and found to have a range of neutralization potentials against a pseudotype virus infection model. Neutralization correlated with GP binding as determined by ELISA. Two of these clones, E10 and F4, potently inhibited authentic SUDV and conferred protection and memory immunity in mice from lethal SUDV challenge. E10 and F4 were further shown to bind to the same epitope on GP as 16F6 with comparable affinities.

In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism(s) of OFSCs regulating macrophage activity in a cytokine-inducible fashion. METHODS: LPS (100 ng/ml)-activated macrophages were treated by conditioned medium from OFSCs (OFSCs-CM) or non-contact cultured with OFSCs for 6 hours. The potency of OFSCs on macrophage proliferation and pro-inflammation ability were determined. Expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, inducible immuno-modulatory factors in OFSCs, were investigated. Deep sequencing analysis as well as interaction between microRNA (miRNA) and genes of immuno-modulators in OFSCs induced by activated macrophages was predicted by miRTar. Transfection of miRNA inhibitor into OFSCs was performed. Real-time RT-PCR and transplantation of OFSCs into mice with LPS-induced ALI confirmed the in vitro and in vivo mechanism. RESULTS: The paracrine effect of OFSCs on inhibition of macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine release was more potent than induction of macrophage G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. OFSCs-CM suppressed LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthetase and the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta expression in macrophages. Under non-contact culture, LPS-activated macrophages effectively triggered the expression of soluble immuno-modulating factors in OFSCs, i.e., IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 RA), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and soluble TNF receptor type II (sTNF RII). Under miRTar prediction, miR-671-5p was identified as a critical microRNA in regulation of multiple immune-modulating factors in OFSCs response to macrophages. The baseline level of miR-671-5p was high in OFSCs, and down-regulation of miR-671-5p upon co-culture with activated macrophages was observed. MiR-671-5p inhibitor transfection into OFSCs selectively enhanced the IL-1 RA and sTNF RII expressions. In addition, inhibition of miR-671-5p in OFSCs enhanced the anti-inflammatory ability against LPS-induced ALI. CONCLUSION: The paracrine effect of OFSCs inhibits the pro-inflammatory ability and proliferation of macrophages. The immune-modulation capacity of OFSCs can be triggered by activated macrophages, and down-regulation of miR-671-5p enhances OFSC immuno-modulation ability by up-regulating IL-1 RA and sTNF RII expression.",2014-08-13,"Lien,Gi-Shih;Liu,Jen-Fang;Chien,Ming-Hsien;Hsu,Wei-Tse;Chang,Tzu-Hao;Ku,Chia-Chi;Ji,AndreaTung-Qian;Tan,Peng;Hsieh,Ting-Lieh;Lee,Liang-Ming;Ho,JenniferH",StemCellResTher,4802483,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1186/scrt486;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25124290/,1i6hni9s,

Biomarkers of disease severity might help in clinical management. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical predictiveness of NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7, and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio in bronchiolitis. METHODS: Previously healthy children less than 24 months of age with bronchiolitis were recruited from the Texas Children's emergency room and intensive care unit from October 2010 to April 2011. Demographic, clinical information, and NW samples were obtained at enrollment. NW samples were analyzed for respiratory viruses, caspase 3/7, and LDH. RESULTS: A viral pathogen was detected in 91·6% of 131 children, with the most common being respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus. A single infection was found in 61·8% of subjects and co-infection in 29·8%. Children admitted to ICU had significantly higher NW-LDH than children sent home from the ER or admitted to the general floor (P = 0·02). Children infected with RSV had the highest NW-LDH concentration (P = 0·03) compared with other viral infections. NW-LDH and NW-caspase were significantly correlated (r = 0·77, P < 0·0001). The univariate models showed NW-LDH and NW-LDH/NW- caspase 3/7 ratio were directly associated with hospitalization. Mutivariate regression analyses suggested a complex interaction between the biomarkers, demographics, and disposition. CONCLUSIONS: NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7 and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio and their interactions with demographic factors are predictive of bronchiolitis severity and can help distinguish children requiring ICU-level care from those admitted to the general floor, or discharged home from the emergency center.",2014-08-12,"Mehta,Reena;Scheffler,Margaret;Tapia,Lorena;Aideyan,Letisha;Patel,KirtidaD;Jewell,AlanM;Avadhanula,Vasanthi;Mei,Minghua;Garofalo,RobertoP;Piedra,PedroA",InfluenzaOtherRespirViruses,10234196,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25132512/;https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12276,0ow8oo82,

A subset of IGR IRESs including that from the honey bee viruses can also direct translation of an overlapping +1 frame gene. In this study, we systematically examined cellular conditions that lead to IGR IRES-mediated 0 and +1 frame translation in Drosophila S2 cells. Towards this, a novel bicistronic reporter that exploits the 2A “stop-go” peptide was developed to allow the detection of IRES-mediated translation in vivo. Both 0 and +1 frame translation by the IGR IRES are stimulated under a number of cellular stresses and in S2 cells infected by cricket paralysis virus, demonstrating a switch from cap-dependent to IRES-dependent translation.

Targeted enrichment improves coverage of highly mutable viruses at low concentration in complex samples. Degenerate primers that anneal to conserved regions can facilitate amplification of divergent, low concentration variants, even when the strain present is unknown. Results. A tool for designing multiplex sets of degenerate sequencing primers to tile overlapping amplicons across multiple whole genomes is described. The new script, run_tiled_primers, is part of the PriMux software. Primers were designed for each segment of South American hemorrhagic fever viruses, tick-borne encephalitis, Henipaviruses, Arenaviruses, Filoviruses, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. Each group is highly diverse with as little as 5% genome consensus. Primer sets were computationally checked for nontarget cross reactions against the NCBI nucleotide sequence database. Primers for murine hepatitis virus were demonstrated in the lab to specifically amplify selected genes from a laboratory cultured strain that had undergone extensive passage in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions. This software should help researchers design multiplex sets of primers for targeted whole genome enrichment prior to sequencing to obtain better coverage of low titer, divergent viruses.

Screenings of BTM from 89 dairy herds during two winter seasons revealed a prevalence of positive herds from 82 per cent to 85 per cent. Eleven herds showed a marked increase in antibody levels between two screenings, indicating new infection. However, two of these herds had been free from BRSV for the last five to seven years. Two newly infected herds were monitored for four years and did not appear to get reinfected. Surprisingly, the BTM antibody levels in these herds remained high throughout the study period, but fluctuated significantly.

However, there has been limited research describing the uptake and use of cattle vaccines on UK farms. AIM: To describe the current uptake and usage of cattle vaccines in the UK. DESIGN: A questionnaire, available in paper and online format, was distributed to cattle farmers by convenience sampling. PARTICIPANTS: All UK cattle farmers were eligible to participate in the study. RESULTS: Eighty-six per cent of respondents (n=229/266) had vaccinated their cattle in the past year. Diseases most commonly vaccinated against were Bovine Viral Diarrhoea, Leptospirosis and Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis. Vaccination compliance was limited in certain areas, for example only 48 per cent of respondents stated that they administered the second dose in the primary course within the recommended timeframe, and 14 per cent of respondents stated that they vaccinated earlier than the youngest recommended age. Although outside the scope of this study, further work is needed to establish the extent of inadequate compliance and the effect this has on vaccine efficacy. The role of the veterinarian was highlighted as the main supplier of vaccines and preferred source of vaccination information. Respondents preferred to receive recommendations regarding vaccination by face-to-face communication with the veterinarian.

Significantly enriched signaling pathways based on deregulated mRNAs were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, etc. CONCLUSIONS: The study was the first report of differentially expressed lncRNAs in CD4(+) T cells response to TB infection and indicated that some lncRNAs may be involved in regulating host immune response to TB infection. Future studies are needed to further elucidate potential roles of these deregulated lncRNAs in LTBI and its reactivation.",2014-06-27,"Yi,Zhengjun;Li,Jianhua;Gao,Kunshan;Fu,Yurong",JInfect,32900523,True,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2014.06.016;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445314001947;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445314001947;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975173/,03c2il49,

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at a university hospital from January 2009 to March 2013. Study subjects included adults (aged ≥18 years) with pneumococcal pneumonia who had undergone laboratory tests for RVI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with severe pneumococcal pneumonia, defined as severity with the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) score ≥91. RESULTS: In total, 191 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia were included for analysis and stratified into 2 groups: the severe group with a PSI score ≥91 (n = 99) and the non-severe group with a PSI score <91 (n = 92). Preceding RVIs were detected in 48 patients, including influenza A virus (n = 20), influenza B virus (n = 4), parainfluenza viruses (n = 5), metapneumovirus (n = 4), rhinovirus (n = 4), respiratory syncytial viruses (n = 6), coronaviruses (n = 2), and mixed viral infections (n = 3).

Bats are linked to a growing number of EID but few studies have explored the factors of viral richness in bats. These may have implications for role of bats as potential reservoirs. We investigated the determinants of viral richness in 15 species of African bats (8 Pteropodidae and 7 microchiroptera) in Central and West Africa for which we provide new information on virus infection and bat phylogeny. We performed the first comparative analysis testing the correlation of the fragmented geographical distribution (defined as the perimeter to area ratio) with viral richness in bats. Because of their potential effect, sampling effort, host body weight, ecological and behavioural traits such as roosting behaviour, migration and geographical range, were included into the analysis as variables. The results showed that the geographical distribution size, shape and host body weight have significant effects on viral richness in bats. Viral richness was higher in large-bodied bats which had larger and more fragmented distribution areas. Accumulation of viruses may be related to the historical expansion and contraction of bat species distribution range, with potentially strong effects of distribution edges on virus transmission. Two potential explanations may explain these results. A positive distribution edge effect on the abundance or distribution of some bat species could have facilitated host switches. Alternatively, parasitism could play a direct role in shaping the distribution range of hosts through host local extinction by virulent parasites. This study highlights the importance of considering the fragmentation of bat species geographical distribution in order to understand their role in the circulation of viruses in Africa.",2014-06-24,"Maganga,GaëlD.;Bourgarel,Mathieu;Vallo,Peter;Dallo,ThiernoD.;Ngoagouni,Carine;Drexler,JanFelix;Drosten,Christian;Nakouné,EmmanuelR.;Leroy,EricM.;Morand,Serge",PLoSOne,12957443,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100172;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24959855/,1rx7p4rs,

Currently, the oral passive immunization using chicken IgY has been focused as an alternative to antibiotics for the treatment and control of diarrhea in animals and humans. This systematic review was focused to determine the effect of IgY in controlling and preventing diarrhea in domesticated animals including Piglets, Mice, Poultry and Calves. METHODS AND RESULTS: Previous research reports focused on treatment effect of Chicken IgY against diarrhea were retrieved from different electronic data bases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPRINGER-LINK, WILEY, AGRICOLA, MEDWELL Journals, Scientific Publish, Chinese articles from Core periodicals in 2012). A total of 61 studies in 4 different animal classes met the inclusion criteria. Data on study characteristics and outcome measures were extracted. The pooled relative risk (RR) of 49 studies of different animals [Piglets – 22; Mice – 14; Poultry – 7 and Calves – 6] in meta-analyses revealed that, IgY significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea in treatment group when compare to the placebo. However, the 95% confidence intervals of the majority of studies in animal class piglets and calves embrace RR of one. The same results were obtained in sub group analyses (treatment regiment – prophylactic or therapeutic; pathogen type – bacterial or viral). Perhaps, this inconsistency in the effect of IgY at the individual study level and overall effect measures could be influenced by the methodological heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis demonstrated the beneficial effect of IgY. This supports the opinion that IgY is useful for prophylaxis and treatment.

Treatment options are scarce, and new drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide, a thiazolide anti-infective, for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 trial in 74 primary care clinics in the USA between Dec 27, 2010, and April 30, 2011. We enrolled participants aged 12–65 years with fever, at least one respiratory symptom, and one constitutional symptom of influenza within 48 h of symptom onset. We randomly assigned participants to receive either nitazoxanide 600 mg, nitazoxanide 300 mg, or placebo twice daily for 5 days, (ratio 1:1:1) and followed them up for 28 days. Randomisation lists were computer generated and done in blocks of three. Sponsor, investigators, study monitors, patients, and laboratory personnel were all masked to treatment allocation in the study. The primary endpoint was the time from first dose to alleviation of symptoms. The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat for participants with influenza infection confirmed by RT-PCR or culture at baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01227421. FINDINGS: Of 650 participants screened, 624 (96%) were enrolled. Of these, 212 were randomly assigned to receive placebo twice a day, 201 to receive nitazoxanide 300 mg twice a day, and 211 to receive nitazoxanide 600 mg a day. The median duration of symptoms for participants receiving placebo was 116·7 h (95% CI 108·1–122·1) compared with 95·5 h (84·0–108·0; p=0·0084) for those receiving 600 mg nitazoxanide and 109·1 h (96·1–129·5, p=0·52) for those receiving 300 mg nitazoxanide. Adverse events were similar between the three groups, the most common being headache reported by 24 (11%) of 212 patients enrolled in placebo group, 12 (6%) of 201 patients in the low-dose group, and 17 (8%) of 211 patients in the high-dose group, or diarrhoea, reported by seven (3%) patients in the placebo group, four (2%) patients enrolled in the low-dose group, and 17 (8%) patients in the high-dose group. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for 5 days was associated with a reduction of the duration of symptoms in participants with acute uncomplicated influenza.

The effects of changes in free water, chloride, l-lactate, albumin and phosphate were calculated, using a modification of the base excess algorithm. When the data were summated for each patient, and correlated to each individual component, the most important contributor to the metabolic acid–base changes, according to the SIM, was chloride (P <0.001).

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) antagonizes BST2 through viral protein u (Vpu), which downregulates BST2 from the cell surface. We report the crystal structure of a protein complex containing Vpu and BST2 cytoplasmic domains and the core of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 (AP1). This, together with our biochemical and functional validations, reveals how Vpu hijacks the AP1-dependent membrane trafficking pathways to mistraffick BST2. Vpu mimics a canonical acidic dileucine-sorting motif to bind AP1 in the cytosol, while simultaneously interacting with BST2 in the membrane. These interactions enable Vpu to build on an intrinsic interaction between BST2 and AP1, presumably causing the observed retention of BST2 in juxtanuclear endosomes and stimulating its degradation in lysosomes. The ability of Vpu to hijack AP-dependent trafficking pathways suggests a potential common theme for Vpu-mediated downregulation of host proteins.

The choice of an adequate level of response relies upon available knowledge of the spatial and temporal parameters governing pathogen spread, affecting, amongst others, the predicted severity of the epidemic. Yet, when a new pathogen is introduced into an alien environment, such information is often lacking or of no use, and epidemiological parameters must be estimated from the first observations of the epidemic. This poses a challenge to epidemiologists: how quickly can the parameters of an emerging disease be estimated? How soon can the future progress of the epidemic be reliably predicted? We investigate these issues using a unique, spatially and temporally resolved dataset for the invasion of a plant disease, Asiatic citrus canker in urban Miami. We use epidemiological models, Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo, and advanced spatial statistical methods to analyse rates and extent of spread of the disease. A rich and complex epidemic behaviour is revealed. The spatial scale of spread is approximately constant over time and can be estimated rapidly with great precision (although the evidence for long-range transmission is inconclusive). In contrast, the rate of infection is characterised by strong monthly fluctuations that we associate with extreme weather events. Uninformed predictions from the early stages of the epidemic, assuming complete ignorance of the future environmental drivers, fail because of the unpredictable variability of the infection rate. Conversely, predictions improve dramatically if we assume prior knowledge of either the main environmental trend, or the main environmental events. A contrast emerges between the high detail attained by modelling in the spatiotemporal description of the epidemic and the bottleneck imposed on epidemic prediction by the limits of meteorological predictability. We argue that identifying such bottlenecks will be a fundamental step in future modelling of weather-driven epidemics.",2014-04-24,"Neri,FrancoM.;Cook,AlexR.;Gibson,GavinJ.;Gottwald,TimR.;Gilligan,ChristopherA.",PLoSComputBiol,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3998883/,01yc7lzk,

Initially, tetherin was shown to restrict replication of various enveloped viruses by inhibiting the release of budding virions from infected cells. More recently, it has become clear that tetherin also acts as a pattern recognition receptor inducing NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory gene expression in virus infected cells. Whereas the ability to restrict virion release is highly conserved among mammalian tetherin orthologs and thus probably an ancient function of this protein, innate sensing seems to be an evolutionarily recent activity. The potent and broad antiviral activity of tetherin is reflected by the fact that many viruses evolved means to counteract this restriction factor. A continuous arms race with viruses has apparently driven the evolution of different isoforms of tetherin with different functional properties. Interestingly, tetherin has also been implicated in cellular processes that are unrelated to immunity, such as the organization of the apical actin network and membrane microdomains or stabilization of the Golgi apparatus.

However, the expression of eIF3f in gastric cancer (GC) is not well understood to date. Therefore, the aim of this study is to detect the expression of eIF3f in GC. METHODS: The expression of eIF3f was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissues with stage I to III GC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT) of 195 gastrectomy specimens; clinicopathological results, including survival, were analyzed. RESULTS: The positive expression rate of eIF3f was significantly higher in ANCT tissues than in GC. eIF3f levels were correlated with more advanced tumor stages and likelihood of recurrence (all P <0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that decreased expression of eIF3f could serve as a prognosis marker for poor outcome of GC patients (P = 0.04).

Viral infections have been transmitted via tissue allografts such as bone, skin, cornea, and heart valves. Bone allografts have transmitted hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and human T-cell leukaemia virus. Corneas have transmitted rabies, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus. Heart valves have been implicated in transmitting hepatitis B. HIV-1 and CMV have been transmitted by skin allografts. Use of comprehensive donor eligibility criteria; excluding potential donors with behaviours risky for HIV-1 and hepatitis infection, and donor blood testing have greatly reduced the risk. Recent reports of HIV transmitted from a seronegative donors prompts the addition of viral nucleic acid testing of the donor. During tissue processing, many allografts are exposed to disinfectants and sterilisation steps such as gamma irradiation, which further reduce or remove the risk of transmitted disease. Some viruses are fairly resistant to gamma irradiation and the high doses needed may be harmful to the tissue allografts. Because the effectiveness of some tissue grafts depends on cellular viability, not all can be subjected to sterilisation steps, and, therefore, the risk of infectious disease transmission remains. For these, preventing the transmission of viral infection relies mostly on careful donor selection and viral testing, but processing with mild disinfectant can be useful. To further assure safety in the use of allografts, the physician and hospital should select tissue banks that follow national professional standards as their source for allografts.",2014-03-27,"Eastlund,Ted",SterilisationofTissuesUsingIonisingRadiations,,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152342/,0gw1drmp,

Consequently, networks have been widely applied in infectious disease modeling. However most studies assume static network structure due to lack of accurate observation and appropriate analytic tools. In this study we used high temporal and spatial resolution animal position data to construct a high-resolution contact network relevant to infectious disease transmission. The animal contact network aggregated at hourly level was highly variable and dynamic within and between days, for both network structure (network degree distribution) and individual rank of degree distribution in the network (degree order). We integrated network degree distribution and degree order heterogeneities with a commonly used contact-based, directly transmitted disease model to quantify the effect of these two sources of heterogeneity on the infectious disease dynamics. Four conditions were simulated based on the combination of these two heterogeneities. Simulation results indicated that disease dynamics and individual contribution to new infections varied substantially among these four conditions under both parameter settings.

We compared the extent of oxidative injury in MS lesions with that in experimental models driven by different inflammatory mechanisms. It was only in a model of coronavirus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis that we detected an accumulation of oxidised phospholipids, which was comparable in extent to that in MS. In both, MS and coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis, this was associated with massive microglial and macrophage activation, accompanied by the expression of the NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox but only sparse expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Acute and chronic CD4(+) T cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis lesions showed transient expression of p22phox and iNOS associated with inflammation. Macrophages in chronic lesions of antibody-mediated demyelinating encephalomyelitis showed lysosomal activity but very little p22phox or iNOS expressions. Active inflammatory demyelinating lesions induced by CD8(+) T cells or by innate immunity showed macrophage and microglial activation together with the expression of p22phox, but low or absent iNOS reactivity. We corroborated the differences between acute CD4(+) T cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and acute MS lesions via gene expression studies. Furthermore, age-dependent iron accumulation and lesion-associated iron liberation, as occurring in the human brain, were only minor in rodent brains.

Among the synthesized conjugates, the presence of a p-tolyl substituent at N-1 of β-lactam ring was preferred for good activity profiles while the increase in spacer length did not influence the efficacy of the compounds. Compounds with high levels of potency were further analysed to determine their IC(50) values, as well as cytotoxicity profiles against mammalian cells. The most active compound in the synthesized conjugates displayed an IC(50) value of 10.49 μM against cultured G3 strain of T. vaginalis and was non-toxic to cultured mammalian HeLa cells at the same concentration.

Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control.",2014-02-20,"Lemey,Philippe;Rambaut,Andrew;Bedford,Trevor;Faria,Nuno;Bielejec,Filip;Baele,Guy;Russell,ColinA.;Smith,DerekJ.;Pybus,OliverG.;Brockmann,Dirk;Suchard,MarcA.",PLoSPathog,11026600,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586153/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003932,04q71md3,

OBJECTIVES: To acquire better understanding on the prevalence and molecular evolution of HAdV-55 strains in China, for an informed strategy for disease control and prevention. POPULATION/METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children with ARTI in Chongqing during 2009–2012. The genotype of HAdV isolates were determined by sequencing the partial hexon and fiber genes. Whole genome sequences of HAdV-55 were obtained for molecular evolution analysis. RESULTS: About 191 (8·55%) HAdV were detected in 2234 children, including 92 (48·2%) with HAdV-7, 72 (37·7%) with HAdV-3, 6 (3·1%) with HAdV-55, 5 (2·6%) with HAdV-5, 4 (2·1%) with HAdV-1, 1 (0·5%) with HAdV-2, and 11(5·8%) with untyped HAdV. Four of these children developed pneumonia, two of whom were diagnosed with severe pneumonia and/or encephalopathy. HAdV-55 isolates clustered with HAdV-11 sequences based on the hexon gene and clustered with HAdV-14 sequences based on the fiber gene and the whole genome. The overall evolutionary rates of hexon gene, fiber gene, and whole genome of HAdV-55 were estimated at 6·2 × 10(−5) s/s/y, 8·0 × 10(−5) s/s/y, and 1·7 × 10(−5) s/s/y, respectively.

However, the detailed analysis of HBV infection under immunosuppression is essential for the prophylaxis and therapy for HBV reactivation and recurrence. In this study, HBV replication and T cell responses were analyzed in a HBV-transfected mouse model under immunosuppressive therapy. During the treatment, HBV replication was at a high level in mice treated with dexamethasone, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide, whereas was terminated in mice treated with mycophenolate mofetil. After the withdrawal, HBV replication was at low or high levels in the dexamethasone-treated mice or in both cyclosporine- and cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The early withdrawal of cyclosporine allowed the recovery of suppressed T cell responses and led to subsequent HBV clearance, while the adoptive immune transfer to the mice with HBV persistence led to HBV suppression. Taken together, long-term HBV persistence under immunosuppression depends on the immunosuppressive drugs used and on the treatment duration and is mediated by the suppressed intrahepatic CD8 T cell response.

Although various enteric pathogens have been implicated, the aetiology of diarrhoea remains unexplained in a large proportion of HIV-1 infected patients. Our aim is to identify the cause of diarrhoea for patients that remain negative in routine diagnostics. METHODS: In this study stool samples of 196 HIV-1 infected persons, including 29 persons with diarrhoea, were examined for enteropathogens and HIV-1. A search for unknown and unexpected viruses was performed using virus discovery cDNA-AFLP combined with Roche-454 sequencing (VIDISCA-454). RESULTS: HIV-1 RNA was detected in stool of 19 patients with diarrhoea (66%) compared to 75 patients (45%) without diarrhoea. In 19 of the 29 diarrhoea cases a known enteropathogen could be identified (66%). Next to these known causative agents, a range of recently identified viruses was identified via VIDISCA-454: cosavirus, Aichi virus, human gyrovirus, and non-A non-B hepatitis virus. Moreover, a novel virus was detected which was named immunodeficiency-associated stool virus (IASvirus). However, PCR based screening for these viruses showed that none of these novel viruses was associated with diarrhoea. Notably, among the 34% enteropathogen-negative cases, HIV-1 RNA shedding in stool was more frequently observed (80%) compared to enteropathogen-positive cases (47%), indicating that HIV-1 itself is the most likely candidate to be involved in diarrhoea.

However, such studies pose unique challenges for field specimen collection, including as we have observed the appearance of mould in some nasal swab specimens. We therefore investigated the impact of sample collection quality and the presence of visible mould in samples upon respiratory virus detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. METHODS: Anterior nasal swab samples were collected from infants participating in an ongoing community-based, longitudinal, dynamic birth cohort study. The samples were first collected from each infant shortly after birth and weekly thereafter. They were then mailed to the laboratory where they were catalogued, stored at -80°C and later screened by PCR for 17 respiratory viruses. The quality of specimen collection was assessed by screening for human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using endogenous retrovirus 3 (ERV3). The impact of ERV3 load upon respiratory virus detection and the impact of visible mould observed in a subset of swabs reaching the laboratory upon both ERV3 loads and respiratory virus detection was determined. RESULTS: In total, 4933 nasal swabs were received in the laboratory. ERV3 load in nasal swabs was associated with respiratory virus detection. Reduced respiratory virus detection (odds ratio 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.44) was observed in samples where the ERV3 could not be identified. Mould was associated with increased time of samples reaching the laboratory and reduced ERV3 loads and respiratory virus detection. CONCLUSION: Suboptimal sample collection and high levels of visible mould can impact negatively upon sample quality.

Importantly, cytokines secreted by CD4+ T cells inhibit JHMV replication in NPCs, and CD8+ T cells specifically target viral peptide-pulsed NPCs for lysis. Furthermore, treatment with IFN-γ inhibits JHMV replication in a dose-dependent manner.

This review describes recent findings of how pathogens do it. RECENT FINDINGS A common theme in interaction between pathogens and host cholesterol metabolism is pathogens targeting lipid rafts of the host plasma membrane. Many intracellular pathogens use rafts as an entry gate, taking advantage of the endocytic machinery and high abundance of outward-looking molecules that can be used as receptors. At the same time, disruption of the rafts' functional capacity, achieved by the pathogens through a number of various means, impairs the ability of the host to generate immune response, thus helping pathogen to thrive. Pathogens cannot synthesize cholesterol, and salvaging host cholesterol helps pathogens build advanced cholesterol-containing membranes and assembly platforms. Impact on cholesterol metabolism is not limited to the infected cells; proteins and microRNAs secreted by infected cells affect lipid metabolism systemically. SUMMARY Given an essential role that host cholesterol metabolism plays in pathogen development, targeting this interaction may be a viable strategy to fight infections, as well as metabolic complications of the infections.",2014-01-01,"Sviridov,Dmitri;Bukrinsky,Michael",Currentopinioninlipidology,25026928,True,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1097/mol.0000000000000106;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25036592/,279ppyzt,

These findings triggered a plethora of reports defining 2-ME benefits for a multitude of immunological processes, primarily with murine models. This led to investigations on 2-ME alterations of (a) immune functions in other species, (b) activities of other cell-types, and (c) in situ diseases. In addition, the early findings may have been instrumental in identification of the previously undefined anticarcinogenic chemicals in specific foods as organosulfurs. Outside the plant organosulfurs, there are no comprehensive reviews of these areas to help define mechanisms by which organosulfurs function as well as identify potential alternative uses. Therefore, the present review will focus on 2-ME alterations of in vitro immune functions in species other than murine; namely, fish, amphibian, reptile, avian, whales, dolphins, rat, hamster, rabbit, guinea pig, feline, canine, porcine, ovine, bovine, and human. Processes, some unique to a given species, were in general, enhanced and in some cases dependent upon the presence of 2-ME. The largest benefits occurred in media that were serum free, followed by those in autologous serum and then fetal bovine serum supplemented medium. Concentrations of 2-ME were generally in the low μM range, with exceptions of those for salamander (20 mM), turtles (70 mM) and dolphins (7 mM). The few studies designed to assess mechanisms found that changes induced by 2-ME were generally accompanied by alterations of reduced/oxidized glutathione cellular concentrations. The major benefit for most studies, however, was to increase the sensitivity of the culture environment, which permitted a specific process to be more easily dissected.",2014-01-01,"Click,RobertE.",JournalofImmunologicalMethods,25788396,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175913003232;http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3946847?pdf=render;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2013.11.007;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175913003232;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24270017/,111p8lps,

To study IgG RFs in patients with other autoimmune diseases, phage display antibody libraries from a hepatitis C virus infected patient with Sjögren's syndrome were constructed. After panning, a specific clone RFL11 was isolated for characterization in advance. The binding activity and specificity of RFL11 to IgG Fc fragment were comparable to those of RFs previously isolated. The analysis with existed RF-Fc complex structures indicated the homology model of RFL11 is similar to IgM RF61 complex with high binding affinity of about 6 × 10(−8) M. This effect resulted from longer complementarity-determining region (CDR) combining key somatic mutations. In the RFL11-Fc interfaces, the CDR-H3 loop forms a finger-like structure extending into the bottom of Fc pocket and resulting in strong ion and cation-pi interactions. Moreover, a process of antigen-driven maturation was proven by somatically mutated VH residues on H2 and H3 CDR loops in the interfaces.

OBJECTIVES: We determined the quality of life (QoL) impact of children’s influenza-like illness (ILI) on their parents. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in childcare centres and a general practice in Sydney, Australia. Using PAR-ENT-QoL, we measured QoL of parents of children aged 6 months–3 years before the 2010 influenza season, then again for parents of children with ILI (ILI group) using SF-12v2 Acute Form and PAR-ENT-QoL, and contemporaneously for parents of aged-matched children without ILI (non-ILI group). RESULTS: Of 381 children enrolled from 90 childcare centres, 105 developed ILI. PAR-ENT-QoL scores of the ILI group were significantly lower in the post-ILI follow-up interviews than at baseline (60.99 vs. 79.77, p < 0.001), and those of non-ILI group at follow-up interviews (60.99 vs. 84.05, p < 0.001). SF-12v2 scores of the ILI group were also significantly lower than those of non-ILI group: physical component summary (50.66 vs. 53.16, p = 0.011) and mental component summary (45.67 vs. 53.66, p < 0.001). Two factors were significantly associated with parental QoL: total time spent caring child during ILI and whether the child had severe ILI or not. Correlations between PAR-ENT-QoL and SF-12v2 scores were satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Parents had significantly lower QoL while their child had ILI, compared with before ILI and with parents of children without ILI. The public health impact of ILI in children on the QoL in families is far from negligible. QoL measurement can complement economic evaluation of ILI disease burden and provide a more complete picture of impact.",2013-12-27,"Chow,MariaYuiKwan;Yin,JiehuiKevin;Heron,Leon;Morrow,Angela;Dierig,Alexa;Booy,Robert;Leask,Julie",QualLifeRes,934162,True,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-013-0606-3;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24370954/,1bqpc3x3,

They were weighed daily during the first month and every seven days from then on. The birds were randomly distributed into 3 groups; 40 quails (group A) and 8 quails (group B) received 3.5 × 10(6) and 5 × 10(6)N. caninum tachyzoites, respectively, and 10 quails (group C) received placebo.

Following euthanasia, the birds were submitted to necropsy, the organs were weighed and fragments were collected for histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR. On the 60th DAI, two dogs were fed tissue obtained from group A quails, and one dog was fed quail tissues from group B. The dogs’ blood was collected weekly for serology, and their feces were collected daily for 33 days for microscopy and molecular identification of oocysts. Student's t-test was used to compare the weights of the collected organs and the quail and cloacal temperature. No quail presented any clinical signs or died. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were the primary necropsy findings during the first week of infection (p < 0.05). Positive serology, immunoreactivity through IHC and molecular identification of the parasite, were observed, especially during the first two weeks of infection.

However, additional challenges must be addressed for efficient RNA interference (RNAi), in particular, endosomal escape. Currently, vast majority of siRNA delivery vehicles are based on cationic materials, which form complexes with negatively charged siRNA. Unfortunately, these approaches complicate the formulations again by forming large complexes with heterogeneous sizes, unfavorable surface charges, colloidal instability, and poor targeting ligand orientation. Here, we report the development of a small and simple protein tag that complements the therapeutic and targeting functionalities of chimera with two functional domains: a dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) for siRNA docking and a pH-dependent polyhistidine to disrupt endosomal membrane. The protein selectively tags along the siRNA block of individual chimera, rendering the overall size of the complex small, desirable for deep tissue penetration, and the aptamer block accessible for target recognition. More interestingly, we found that extending the c-terminal polyhistidine segment in the protein tag to 18 amino acids completely abolishes the RNA binding function of dsRBD.",2013-11-07,"Liu,HongYan;Gao,Xiaohu",SciRep,32599048,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24196104/;https://doi.org/10.1038/srep03129,0atfsivf,

Currently, many viruses can be identified by sequencing without knowledge of the pathogenicity of the virus. However, attributing the presence of a virus in patient material to a disease in the patient can be a challenge. One approach to meet this challenge is identification of viral sequences based on enrichment by autologous patient antibody capture. This method facilitates identification of viruses that have provoked an immune response within the patient and may increase the sensitivity of the current virus discovery techniques. To demonstrate the utility of this method, virus discovery deep sequencing (VIDISCA-454) was performed on clinical samples from 19 patients: 13 with a known respiratory viral infection and 6 with a known gastrointestinal viral infection. Patient sera was collected from one to several months after the acute infection phase. Input and antibody capture material was sequenced and enrichment was assessed. In 18 of the 19 patients, viral reads from immunogenic viruses were enriched by antibody capture (ranging between 1.5x to 343x in respiratory material, and 1.4x to 53x in stool). Enriched reads were also determined in an identity independent manner by using a novel algorithm Xcompare. In 16 of the 19 patients, 21% to 100% of the enriched reads were derived from infecting viruses.

Questionnaires are usually built de novo for each event, resulting in substantially delayed epidemiological responses that are detrimental to the understanding and control of the event considered. Moreover, the public health and/or academic institution databases constructed with responses to different questionnaires are usually difficult to merge, impairing necessary collaborations. We aimed to show that e-commerce concepts and software tools can be readily adapted to enable rapid collection of data after an infectious disease outbreak or environmental disaster. Here, the ‘customers’ are the epidemiologists, who fill their shopping ‘baskets’ with standardised questions. METHODS: For each epidemiological field, a catalogue of questions is constituted by identifying the relevant variables based on a review of the published literature on similar circumstances. Each question is tagged with information on its source papers. Epidemiologists can then tailor their own questionnaires by choosing appropriate questions from this catalogue. The software immediately provides them with ready-to-use forms and online questionnaires. All databases constituted by the different EpiBasket users are interoperable, because the corresponding questionnaires are derived from the same corpus of questions. RESULTS: A proof-of-concept prototype was developed for Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) surveys, which is one of the fields of the epidemiological investigation frequently explored during, or after, an outbreak or environmental disaster. The catalogue of questions was initiated from a review of the KAP studies conducted during or after the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic.

RESULTS: We presented the results obtained using 8 genetically predisposed randomly chosen individuals reproducing both the absence and presence of malfunctions of the Teff-Treg cross-balancing mechanisms at a local level. For simulating the absence of a local malfunction we supposed that both Teff and Treg populations had similar maximum duplication rates. Results presented here suggest that presence of a genetic predisposition is not always a sufficient condition for developing the disease. Other conditions such as a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate and allow peripheral tolerance should be involved.

The remaining three viruses were versions of wt rAPMV-2, -4 and -7 in which the F cleavage site had been modified to be multi-basic. Rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally and monitored for clinical disease, virus shedding from the upper and lower respiratory tract, and seroconversion. Virus shedding was not detected for wt APMV-5. Very limited shedding was detected for wt rAPMV-4 and modified rAPMV-4, and only in a subset of animals. Shedding by the other viruses was detected in every infected animal, and usually from both the upper and lower respiratory tract. In particular, shedding over a number of days in every animal was observed for modified rAPMV-2, wt APMV-7, and modified rAPMV-7. Modification of the F protein cleavage site appeared to increase shedding by wt rAPMV-2 and marginally by wt rAPMV-4. All APMVs except wt APMV-5 induced a virus-specific serum antibody response in all infected animals. None of the animals exhibited any clinical disease signs. These results indicate that APMVs 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 are competent to infect non-human primates, but are moderately-to-highly restricted, depending on the serotype. This suggests that they are not likely to significantly infect primates in nature, and represent promising attenuated candidates for vector development.",2013-10-10,"Khattar,SunilK.;Nayak,Baibaswata;Kim,Shin-Hee;Xiao,Sa;Samal,Sweety;Paldurai,Anandan;Buchholz,UrsulaJ.;Collins,PeterL.;Samal,SibaK.",PLoSOne,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3794941/,0littefv,

The incidence, clinical presentation and outcome of symptomatic and asymptomatic VRTI in HSCT outpatient unit were prospectively evaluated during a single influenza season (January–March 2011). Pharyngeal swabs were performed at the first visit and if new symptoms were present. Molecular multiplex assay for 12 respiratory viruses was performed by the regional reference laboratory. Among 264 swabs from 193 outpatients, 58 (22 %) resulted positive for 61 viruses (influenza, n = 20; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], n = 21; rhinovirus, n = 12; coronavirus, n = 4; adenovirus, n = 3; parainfluenza, n = 1). VRTI were detected more frequently in the presence of symptoms than in asymptomatic patients: 49 out of 162 (30 %) vs. 9 out of 102 (9 %), p < 0.001. Influenza-like illness syndrome (ILI) was significantly associated with a VRTI if compared to other presentations (42 %), while the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control definition was not (30 %). Positive predictive value (PPV) of ILI for influenza was 17 %. Influenza and RSV peak periods were contemporary. Influenza prophylaxis was given to 25 patients following exposure. Low rate of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract infection (approximately 5 % for influenza and RSV), no nosocomial epidemics and no VRTI-related deaths were observed. VRTI are very frequent in high-risk haematology outpatients, but symptoms are aspecific and PPV of ILI is low. Symptoms of influenza and RSV overlap.

METHODS: Four thousands and forty-eight healthy adults aged ≥18 years were randomized (1:1) to receive one dose of either the adjuvanted split virion (3.75 μg hemagglutinin antigen [HA]/AS03) or non-adjuvanted (15 μg HA) vaccine. Hemagglutination inhibition [HI] antibody response was evaluated before vaccination and at Days 21, 42 and 182 (Month 6). Safety of the study vaccines was evaluated during the entire study duration. RESULTS: At Day 21, both study vaccines induced HI immune responses meeting the US regulatory criteria in subjects 18–64 years (seroprotection rate [SPR]: 98.0% [97.1–98.6]; seroconversion rate [SCR]: 89.7% [88.0–91.2] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 91.4% [89.9–92.8]; SCR: 74.6% [72.3–76.9] in the non-adjuvanted group) and >64 years of age (SPR: 86.0% [82.5–89.0]; SCR: 75.3% [71.1–79.2] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 69.1% [64.6–73.3]; SCR: 56.7% [52.0–61.3] in the non-adjuvanted group). The AS03-adjuvanted vaccine induced higher HI geometric mean titers than the non-adjuvanted vaccine at all time points. At Month 6, only subjects 18–64 years of age from both vaccine groups still met the US regulatory criteria (SPR: 82.1% [80.0–84.1]; SCR: 62.3% [59.6–64.8] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 75.3% [72.9–77.5]; SCR: 53.7% [51.0–56.4] in the non-adjuvanted group). Protective efficacy was not evaluated due to low number of RT-qPCR-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza cases. Through Month 12, 216 serious adverse events (in 157 subjects: 84 in the AS03-adjuvanted and 73 in the non-adjuvanted group) and 12 potentially immune mediated diseases (5 in the AS03-adjuvanted and 7 in the non-adjuvanted group) were reported. CONCLUSION: A single dose of either adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine induced protective HI antibody levels against the A/California/7/2009 strain that persisted through Month 6 in the 18–64 years population.",2013-09-13,"Yang,WilliamH.;Dionne,Marc;Kyle,Michael;Aggarwal,Naresh;Li,Ping;Madariaga,Miguel;Godeaux,Olivier;Vaughn,DavidW.",Vaccine,25880491,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X13009286;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.07.007;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13009286;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23856331/,08u3x1z4,

The construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome in a bacterial artificial chromosome is reported here, providing a reverse genetics system to study the molecular biology of the virus and to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates. Following transfection with the cDNA clone, infectious virus was rescued in both Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells. Recombinant MERS-CoVs (rMERS-CoVs) lacking the accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 were successfully rescued from cDNA clones with these genes deleted. The mutant viruses presented growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus, indicating that accessory genes were not essential for MERS-CoV replication in cell cultures. In contrast, an engineered mutant virus lacking the structural E protein (rMERS-CoV-ΔE) was not successfully rescued, since viral infectivity was lost at early passages. Interestingly, the rMERS-CoV-ΔE genome replicated after cDNA clone was transfected into cells. The infectious virus was rescued and propagated in cells expressing the E protein in trans, indicating that this virus was replication competent and propagation defective. Therefore, the rMERS-CoV-ΔE mutant virus is potentially a safe and promising vaccine candidate to prevent MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Since the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula during the summer of 2012, it has already spread to 10 different countries, infecting around 94 persons and showing a mortality rate higher than 50%. This article describes the development of the first reverse genetics system for MERS-CoV, based on the construction of an infectious cDNA clone inserted into a bacterial artificial chromosome. Using this system, a collection of rMERS-CoV deletion mutants has been generated. Interestingly, one of the mutants with the E gene deleted was a replication-competent, propagation-defective virus that could only be grown in the laboratory by providing E protein in trans, whereas it would only survive a single virus infection cycle in vivo.

The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) highlighted the potentially lethal consequences of CoV-induced disease in humans. In 2012, a novel CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus; MERS-CoV) emerged, causing 49 human cases thus far, of which 23 had a fatal outcome. In this study, we characterized MERS-CoV replication and cytotoxicity in human and monkey cell lines. Electron microscopy of infected Vero cells revealed extensive membrane rearrangements, including the formation of double-membrane vesicles and convoluted membranes, which have been implicated previously in the RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV and other CoVs. Following infection, we observed rapidly increasing viral RNA synthesis and release of high titres of infectious progeny, followed by a pronounced cytopathology. These characteristics were used to develop an assay for antiviral compound screening in 96-well format, which was used to identify cyclosporin A as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication in cell culture. Furthermore, MERS-CoV was found to be 50–100 times more sensitive to alpha interferon (IFN-α) treatment than SARS-CoV, an observation that may have important implications for the treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients. MERS-CoV infection did not prevent the IFN-induced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1, in contrast to infection with SARS-CoV where this block inhibits the expression of antiviral genes.

We develop an agent-based model (ABM), in which each individual is explicitly represented and vector populations are linked to precipitation estimates in a tropical setting. The model is implemented on both scale-free and regular networks. The spatio-temporal transmission of chikungunya is analysed and the presence of asymptomatic silent spreaders within the population is investigated in the context of implementing travel restrictions during an outbreak. Preventing the movement of symptomatic individuals is found to be an insufficient mechanism to halt the spread of the disease, which can be readily carried to neighbouring nodes via sub-clinical individuals.

The aim of this research was to assess the potential of utilising Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) assessments in providing a framework for a rapid response to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This novel approach applies a scientific process, widely used in food production systems, to assess risks related to a specific emerging health threat within a known zoonotic disease hotspot.

Our HACCP assessment identified poultry flock isolation, transportation, slaughter, preparation and consumption as critical control points for Vietnam’s domestic poultry trade.

They play a role in innate and adaptive immunity and are targets for various bacterial and viral adhesins. Two pathogens that colonize the normally sterile lower respiratory tract in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) and Moraxella catarrhalis. Both pathogens bind to CEACAMs and elicit a variety of cellular reactions, including bacterial internalization, cell adhesion and apoptosis. METHODS: To analyze the (co-) expression of CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in different lung tissues with respect to COPD, smoking status and granulocyte infiltration, immunohistochemically stained paraffin sections of 19 donors were studied. To address short-term effects of cigarette smoke and acute inflammation, transcriptional regulation of CEACAM5, CEACAM6 and different CEACAM1 isoforms by cigarette smoke extract, interferons, Toll-like receptor agonists, and bacteria was tested in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells by quantitative PCR. Corresponding CEACAM protein levels were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections showed the most frequent and intense staining for CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in bronchial and alveolar epithelium, but revealed no significant differences in connection with COPD, smoking status and granulocyte infiltration. In NHBE cells, mRNA expression of CEACAM1 isoforms CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-4S, CEACAM1-3L and CEACAM1-3S were up-regulated by interferons alpha, beta and gamma, as well as the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Interferon-gamma also increased CEACAM5 expression. These results were confirmed on protein level by FACS analysis. Importantly, also NTHI and M. catarrhalis increased CEACAM1 mRNA levels. This effect was independent of the ability to bind to CEACAM1. The expression of CEACAM6 was not affected by any treatment or bacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not find a direct correlation between CEACAM1 expression and COPD, the COPD-associated bacteria NTHi and M. catarrhalis were able to increase the expression of their own receptor on host cells.

Although related viruses infect bats, molecular clock analyses have been unable to identify direct ancestors of MERS-CoV. Anecdotal exposure histories suggest that patients had been in contact with dromedary camels or goats. We investigated possible animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock. METHODS: We took sera from animals in the Middle East (Oman) and from elsewhere (Spain, Netherlands, Chile). Cattle (n=80), sheep (n=40), goats (n=40), dromedary camels (n=155), and various other camelid species (n=34) were tested for specific serum IgG by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S1 subunits of spike proteins of MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human coronavirus OC43. Results were confirmed by virus neutralisation tests for MERS-CoV and bovine coronavirus. FINDINGS: 50 of 50 (100%) sera from Omani camels and 15 of 105 (14%) from Spanish camels had protein-specific antibodies against MERS-CoV spike. Sera from European sheep, goats, cattle, and other camelids had no such antibodies. MERS-CoV neutralising antibody titres varied between 1/320 and 1/2560 for the Omani camel sera and between 1/20 and 1/320 for the Spanish camel sera. There was no evidence for cross-neutralisation by bovine coronavirus antibodies. INTERPRETATION: MERS-CoV or a related virus has infected camel populations. Both titres and seroprevalences in sera from different locations in Oman suggest widespread infection.

To comprehensively investigate the complex interaction between HSV-1 and its host we combined two genome-scale screens for host factors (HFs) involved in virus replication. A yeast two-hybrid screen for protein interactions and a RNA interference (RNAi) screen with a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library confirmed existing and identified novel HFs which functionally influence HSV-1 infection. Bioinformatic analyses found the 358 HFs were enriched for several pathways and multi-protein complexes. Of particular interest was the identification of Med23 as a strongly anti-viral component of the largely pro-viral Mediator complex, which links specific transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. The anti-viral effect of Med23 on HSV-1 replication was confirmed in gain-of-function gene overexpression experiments, and this inhibitory effect was specific to HSV-1, as a range of other viruses including Vaccinia virus and Semliki Forest virus were unaffected by Med23 depletion. We found Med23 significantly upregulated expression of the type III interferon family (IFN-λ) at the mRNA and protein level by directly interacting with the transcription factor IRF7. The synergistic effect of Med23 and IRF7 on IFN-λ induction suggests this is the major transcription factor for IFN-λ expression. Genotypic analysis of patients suffering recurrent orofacial HSV-1 outbreaks, previously shown to be deficient in IFN-λ secretion, found a significant correlation with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IFN-λ3 (IL28b) promoter strongly linked to Hepatitis C disease and treatment outcome.

There are multiple murine models of severe respiratory viral infections that have been used to identify viral and host factors that contribute to disease severity. Primary cultures of murine alveolar epithelial cells provide a robust in vitro model to perform mechanistic studies that can be correlated with in vivo studies to identify cell type-specific factors that contribute to pathology within the alveoli of the lung during viral infection. In this study, we established an in vitro model to compare the responses of type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) alveolar epithelial cells to infection by respiratory viruses used in murine models: mouse-adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV, v2163), murine coronavirus MHV-1, and influenza A (H1N1) virus, strain PR8. Murine alveolar cells cultured to maintain an ATII cell phenotype, determined by expression of LBP180, were susceptible to infection by all three viruses. In contrast, ATII cells that were cultured to trans-differentiate into an ATI-like cell phenotype were susceptible to MHV-1 and PR8, but not mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. Epithelial cells produce cytokines in response to viral infections, thereby activating immune responses. Thus, virus-induced cytokine expression was quantified in ATI and ATII cells. Both cell types had increased expression of IL-1β mRNA upon viral infection, though at different levels. While MHV-1 and PR8 induced expression of a number of shared cytokines in ATI cells, there were several cytokines whose expression was induced uniquely by MHV-1 infection.

The complex interplay between virus-encoded and host-specific pathogenicity regulators – and the relative contributions of each toward viral pathogenicity – is not well-understood. RESULTS: By analyzing a collection of lung samples from mice infected by A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; VN1203), we characterized a signature of transcripts and proteins associated with the kinetics of the host response. Using a new geometrical representation method and two criteria, we show that inoculation concentrations and four specific mutations in VN1203 mainly impact the magnitude and velocity of the host response kinetics, rather than specific sets of up- and down- regulated genes. We observed analogous kinetic effects using lung samples from mice infected with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), and we show that these effects correlate with morbidity and viral titer. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the importance of the kinetics of the host response to H5N1 pathogenesis and its relationship with clinical disease severity and virus replication. These kinetic properties imply that time-matched comparisons of ‘omics profiles to viral infections give limited views to differentiate host-responses.

Seasonality has been reported for many viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the recently described human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We hypothesize that the availability of rapid, multiplex PCR diagnostics will provide better clinical care and new insights into the etiology and clinical spectrum of RTIs. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of respiratory pathogens at a 500-bed adult and 154-bed pediatric hospital tertiary care center. A total of 939 specimens from patients with an age range of 5 days to 91 years (median, 2 years) were tested by a multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012. Sixty-five percent of specimens were positive for at least one pathogen. As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent (34.3 %) followed by RSV (19.2 %) and hMPV (6.2 %). Twelve percent of the positive samples were positive for multiple analytes, with Rhino/Entero and RSV being the most common combination. The peak months were September and May for Rhino/Entero infections, January for RSV and February for coronavirus. hMPV peaked 2 months after RSV, as has been observed recently in other studies. Multiplex PCR provides rapid diagnostic information that can be used to make knowledgeable clinical decisions and potentially reduce the use of antibiotics.

However, proof for the existence of such factors has been limited and mainly anecdotal. Therefore, we sought evidence for genetic susceptibility to FIP using feline high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Birman cats were chosen for GWAS because they are highly inbred and suffer a high incidence of FIP. DNA from 38 Birman cats that died of FIP and 161 healthy cats from breeders in Denmark and USA were selected for genotyping using 63K SNPs distributed across the feline genome. Danish and American Birman cats were closely related and the populations were therefore combined and analyzed in two manners: 1) all cases (FIP) vs. all controls (healthy) regardless of age, and 2) cases 1–1/2 years of age and younger (most susceptible) vs. controls 2 years of age and older (most resistant). GWAS of the second cohort was most productive in identifying significant genome-wide associations between case and control cats. Four peaks of association with FIP susceptibility were identified, with two being identified on both analyses. Five candidate genes ELMO1, RRAGA, TNFSF10, ERAP1 and ERAP2, all relevant to what is known about FIP virus pathogenesis, were identified but no single association was fully concordant with the disease phenotype.

We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%).

This virus is commonly found in environmental waters and is very resistant to water disinfection and environmental stressors, especially UV light inactivation. Molecular techniques, such as PCR-based methods (Polymerase Chain Reaction), are commonly used to detect and identify viral contamination in water, although PCR alone does not allow the discrimination between infectious and non-infectious viral particles. A combination of cell culture and PCR has allowed detection of infectious viruses that grow slowly or fail to produce cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture. This study aimed to assess the integrity and viability of human adenovirus (HAdV) in environmental water and evaluate circulating strains by molecular characterization in three sites of the water supply in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina Island, Brazil: Peri Lagoon water, spring source water, and water from the public water supply system. METHODS: Water samples were collected, concentrated and HAdV quantified by real-time PCR. Viral integrity was evaluated by enzymatic assay (DNase I) and infectivity by plaque assay (PA) and integrated cell culture using transcribed mRNA (ICC-RT-qPCR). Samples containing particles of infectious HAdV were selected for sequencing and molecular characterization. RESULTS: The analyzed sites contained 83, 66 and 58% undamaged HAdV particles (defined as those in which the genetic material is protected by the viral capsid) at Peri Lagoon, spring source water and public supply system water, respectively. Of these, 66% of the particles (by PA) and 75% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) HAdV were shown to be infectious, due to being undamaged in Peri Lagoon, 33% (by PA) and 58% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in spring source water and 8% (by PA) and 25% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in the public water supply system.

When immune functions are still largely immature, the airway epithelium plays a primary defensive role since, besides providing a physical barrier, it is also involved in the innate and the adaptive immune responses. A study was therefore designed to evaluate in vitro whether pidotimod, a synthetic dipeptide able to stimulate the inflammatory and immune effector cells, could activate bronchial epithelial cell functions involved in response to infections. METHODS: BEAS-2B cell line (human bronchial epithelial cells infected with a replication-defective Adenovirus 12-SV40 virus hybrid) were cultured in the presence of pidotimod, with or without tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or zymosan to assess: a) intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression, by flow cytometry; b) toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 expression and production, by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and western blotting; d) interleukin (IL)-8 release, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); e) activated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) activation, by western blotting. RESULTS: The constitutive expression of ICAM-1 and IL-8 release were significant up-regulated by TNF-α (ICAM-1) and by TNF-α and zymosan (IL-8), but not by pidotimod. In contrast, an increased TLR-2 expression was found after exposure to pidotimod 10 and 100 μg/ml (p < 0.05) and to the association pidotimod 100 μg/ml + TNF-α (p < 0.05). Western blot analysis substantiated that the constitutive TLR-2 expression was significantly increased after exposure to all the stimuli. Finally, while a remarkable inhibition of TNF-α -induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed in the presence of pidotimod, both TNF-α and pidotimod were effective in inducing NF-kB protein expression in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation. CONCLUSION: Through different effects on ERK1/2 and NF-kB, pidotimod was able to increase the expression of TLR-2 proteins, surface molecules involved in the initiation of the innate response to infectious stimuli. The lack of effect on ICAM-1 expression, the receptor for rhinovirus, and on IL-8 release, the potent chemotactic factor for neutrophils (that are already present in sites of infection), may represent protective functions. If confirmed in vivo, these activities may, at least in part, clarify the mechanism of action of this molecule at airway level.",2013-05-10,"Carta,Sonia;Silvestri,Michela;Rossi,GiovanniA",ItalJPediatr,873954,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663325/;https://doi.org/10.1186/1824-7288-39-29,294qejgv,

This study was aimed to develop an improved method for rapid recovery of CSFV directly from cloned cDNA. Full-length genomic cDNA from the CSFV Shimen strain, which was flanked by a T7 promoter, the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and T7 terminator sequences, was cloned into the low-copy vector pOK12, producing pOKShimen-RzTΦ. Direct transfection of pOKShimen-RzTΦ into PK/T7 cells, a PK-15-derived cell line stably expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, allowed CSFV to be rescued rapidly and efficiently, i.e., at least 12 h faster and 31.6-fold greater viral titer when compared with the in vitro transcription-based rescue system. Furthermore, the progeny virus rescued from PK/T7 cells was indistinguishable, both in vitro and in vivo, from its parent virus and the virus rescued from classical reverse genetics. The reverse genetics based on intracellular transcription is efficient, convenient and cost-effective.

Since first identified in 1989, HCV has been estimated to infect 170 million people worldwide. Mostly chronic hepatitis C virus has a uniform natural history, from liver cirrhosis to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The current therapy for HCV infection consists of a combination of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin. On the other hand, HCV-related liver disease is also the leading indication for liver transplantation. However, posttransplant HCV re-infection of the graft has been reported to be universal. Furthermore, the graft after HCV re-infection often results in accelerated progression to liver failure. In addition, treatment of recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation is often compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon-based therapies. Taken together, poor outcome after HCV re-infection, regardless of grafts or recipients, poses a major issue for the hepatologists and transplant surgeons. The aim of this paper is to review several specific aspects regarding HCV re-infection after transplant: risk factors, current therapeutics for HCV in different stages of liver transplantation, cellular function of HCV proteins, and molecular mechanisms of HCV entry. Hopefully, this paper will inspire new strategies and novel inhibitors against recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation and greatly improve its overall outcome.",2013-04-23,"Hsu,Shih-Hsien;Yeh,Ming-Lun;Wang,Shen-Nien",ClinDevImmunol,1487961,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23710205/;https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/890517,0hbeso65,

To establish an effective surveillance to monitor transboundary spread of bat viruses between Myanmar and China, complete organs from the thorax and abdomen from 853 bats of six species from two Myanmar counties close to Yunnan province, China, were collected and tested for their virome through metagenomics by Solexa sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. In total, 3,742,314 reads of 114 bases were generated, and over 86% were assembled into 1,649,512 contigs with an average length of 114 bp, of which 26,698 (2%) contigs were recognizable viral sequences belonging to 24 viral families. Of the viral contigs 45% (12,086/26,698) were related to vertebrate viruses, 28% (7,443/26,698) to insect viruses, 27% (7,074/26,698) to phages and 95 contigs to plant viruses. The metagenomic results were confirmed by PCR of selected viruses in all bat samples followed by phylogenetic analysis, which has led to the discovery of some novel bat viruses of the genera Mamastrovirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus, Iflavirus and Orthohepadnavirus and to their prevalence rates in two bat species.

However, how these genes evolved and to what extent they diverged in humans remain to be investigated specifically. Based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes, we reveal that diverging homologs with a prototypic CEACAM architecture–including an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin variable and constant domain-like regions, and an intracellular domain containing ITAM motif–are present from cartilaginous fish to humans, but are absent in sea lamprey, cephalochordate or urochordate. Interestingly, the CEACAM/PSG gene inventory underwent radical divergence in various vertebrate lineages: from zero in avian species to dozens in therian mammals. In addition, analyses of genetic variations in human populations showed the presence of various types of copy number variations (CNVs) at the CEACAM/PSG locus. These copy number polymorphisms have 3–80% frequency in select populations, and encompass single to more than six PSG genes. Furthermore, we found that CEACAM/PSG genes contain a significantly higher density of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) compared to the chromosome average, and many CEACAM/PSG SNPs exhibit high population differentiation. Taken together, our study suggested that CEACAM/PSG genes have had a more dynamic evolutionary history in vertebrates than previously thought.

HCoV-EMC is phylogenetically closely related to Tylonycteris-bat-coronavirus-HKU4 and Pipistrellus-bat-coronavirus-HKU5 in Hong Kong. We conducted a seroprevalence study on archived sera from 94 game-food animal handlers at a wild life market, 28 SARS patients, and 152 healthy blood donors in Southern China to assess the zoonotic potential and evidence for intrusion of HCoV-EMC and related viruses into humans. METHODS: Anti-HCoV-EMC and anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were detected using screening indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and confirmatory neutralizing antibody tests. RESULTS: Two (2.1%) animal handlers had IF antibody titer of ≥1:20 against both HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV with neutralizing antibody titer of <1:10. No blood donor had antibody against either virus. Surprisingly, 17/28 (60.7%) of SARS patients had significant IF antibody titers with 7/28 (25%) having anti-HCoV-EMC neutralizing antibodies at low titers which significantly correlated with that of HCoV-OC43. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a significant B-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat-2 region of Spike protein.

Results The majority of HCWs put on gloves (88%, n = 390), gown (83%, n = 368), and mask (88%, n = 386). Only 37% (n = 163) were observed to have put on eye protection.

TIM1 also robustly enhanced the infection of replication-competent viruses from the same families, including dengue, Tacaribe, Sindbis and Ross River viruses. All interactions between TIM1 and pseudoviruses or VLPs were PS-mediated, as demonstrated with liposome blocking and TIM1 mutagenesis experiments.

We performed a detailed structural analysis of DENV-MINI RNA, combining chemical acylation techniques, Pb(2+) ion-induced hydrolysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Our results highlight protein-independent 5′–3′ terminal interactions involving hybridization between recognized cis-acting motifs. Probing analyses identified tandem dumbbell structures (DBs) within the 3′ terminus spaced by single-stranded regions, internal loops and hairpins with embedded GNRA-like motifs. Analysis of conserved motifs and top loops (TLs) of these dumbbells, and their proposed interactions with downstream pseudoknot (PK) regions, predicted an H-type pseudoknot involving TL1 of the 5′ DB and the complementary region, PK2. As disrupting the TL1/PK2 interaction, via ‘flipping’ mutations of PK2, previously attenuated DENV replication, this pseudoknot may participate in regulation of RNA synthesis. Computer modeling implied that this motif might function as autonomous structural/regulatory element. In addition, our studies targeting elements of the 3′ DB and its complementary region PK1 indicated that communication between 5′–3′ terminal regions strongly depends on structure and sequence composition of the 5′ cyclization region.",2013-03-26,"Sztuba-Solinska,Joanna;Teramoto,Tadahisa;Rausch,JasonW.;Shapiro,BruceA.;Padmanabhan,Radhakrishnan;LeGrice,StuartF.J.",NucleicAcidsRes,,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3643606/,1pbd4maf,

This NoLS is a sequence containing three clusters of two or three basic amino acids. We fused the amino terminal of NOA36 to eGFP in order to characterize this putative NoLS. We show that a cluster of three lysine residues at positions 3 to 5 within this sequence is critical for the nucleolar localization. We also demonstrate that the sequence as found in human is capable of directing eGFP to the nucleolus in several mammal, fish and insect cells. Moreover, this NoLS is capable of specifically directing the cytosolic yeast enzyme polyphosphatase to the target of the nucleolus of HeLa cells, wherein its enzymatic activity was detected.

Interactions between co-infecting parasites include resource competition, direct competition and immune-mediated interactions and each are likely to alter the dynamics of single parasites. We posit that co-infection is a driver of variation in parasite establishment and growth, ultimately altering the production of parasite transmission stages. To test this hypothesis, three different treatment groups of laboratory mice were infected with the gastrointestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus, the respiratory bacterial pathogen Bordetella bronchiseptica lux(+) or co-infected with both parasites. To follow co-infection simultaneously, self-bioluminescent bacteria were used to quantify infection in vivo and in real-time, while helminth egg production was monitored in real-time using faecal samples. Co-infection resulted in high bacterial loads early in the infection (within the first 5 days) that could cause host mortality. Co-infection also produced helminth ‘super-shedders’; individuals that chronically shed the helminth eggs in larger than average numbers. Our study shows that co-infection may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the often-observed high variance in parasite load and shedding rates, and should thus be taken into consideration for disease management and control. Further, using self-bioluminescent bacterial reporters allowed quantification of the progression of infection within the whole animal of the same individuals at a fine temporal scale (daily) and significantly reduced the number of animals used (by 85%) compared with experiments that do not use in vivo techniques. Thus, we present bioluminescent imaging as a novel, non-invasive tool offering great potential to be taken forward into other applications of infectious disease ecology.",2013-03-06,"Lass,Sandra;Hudson,PeterJ.;Thakar,Juilee;Saric,Jasmina;Harvill,Eric;Albert,Réka;Perkins,SarahE.",JRSocInterface,8891751,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2012.0588;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256186/,0952gzw1,

However, a ‘mismatch between present professional competencies and the requirements of an increasingly interdependent world’ has been identified. Postgraduate training should take account of the increasingly global nature of health; this paper examines the extent to which they currently do. DESIGN: Trainees across 11 medical specialties reviewed the content of their postgraduate curriculum. SETTING: Not relevant. PARTCIPANTS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Competencies were coded as ‘UK’ (statement only relevant to UK work), ‘global’ (statement with an explicit reference to aspects of health outside the UK) or generic (relevant both to the UK and international settings). RESULTS: Six of the 11 curricula reviewed contained global health competencies. These covered the global burden or determinants of disease and appropriate policy responses. Only one College required trainees to ‘be aware of the World Health Organization’, or ‘know the local, national and international structures for health care’. These cross-cutting competencies have applicability to all specialties. All 11 curricula contained generic competencies where a global health perspective and/or experience could be advantageous, e.g. caring for migrant or culturally different patients. CONCLUSION: Trainees in all specialties should achieve a minimum requirement of global health awareness. This can be achieved through a small number of common competencies that are consistent across core curricula. These should lead on from equivalent undergraduate competencies.

CD8(+) T cell expansions from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were also capable of secreting the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), although in vivo CD8(+) T cell depletion did not significantly alter Mtb burden. Further analysis revealed that pulmonary CD8(+) T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were clonally expanded, preferentially expressing T cell receptor (TcR) Vβ chain 8 (8.2, 8.3) or Vβ 14. Although Vβ8(+) CD8(+) T cells were responsible for the majority of IL-10 production, in vivo depletion of Vβ8(+) did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN-γ secreting profiles.

The risk of widespread epidemics in humans can be assessed by monitoring the reproduction number R (average number of persons infected by a human case). However, until now, estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters, for which resources and expertise are not always available. Additionally, existing methods do not correct for important selection and under-ascertainment biases. Here, we present simple estimation methods that overcome many of these limitations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our approach is based on a parsimonious mathematical model of disease transmission and only requires data collected through routine surveillance and standard case investigations. We apply it to assess the transmissibility of swine-origin influenza A H3N2v-M virus in the US, Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and also present a non-zoonotic example (cholera in the Dominican Republic). Estimation is based on two simple summary statistics, the proportion infected by the natural reservoir among detected cases (G) and among the subset of the first detected cases in each cluster (F). If detection of a case does not affect detection of other cases from the same cluster, we find that R can be estimated by 1−G; otherwise R can be estimated by 1−F when the case detection rate is low. In more general cases, bounds on R can still be derived. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a simple approach with limited data requirements that enables robust assessment of the risks posed by emerging zoonoses. We illustrate this by deriving transmissibility estimates for the H3N2v-M virus, an important step in evaluating the possible pandemic threat posed by this virus.

Our study estimated two key time constants for the model that are important parameters for reducing the computing costs. The two time constants estimated were verified by airflow data from both an office and an aircraft cabin case. This study also conducted experiments in the first-class cabin of an MD-82 commercial airliner with heated manikins to validate the hybrid model. A pulse particle source was applied at the mouth of an index manikin to simulate a cough. The particle concentrations versus time were measured at the breathing zone of the other manikins. The trend of particle concentrations versus time predicted by the hybrid model agrees with the experimental data.

Although the manifestations of coronavirus infection (i.e., rhinorrhea, sneezing, cough, nasal obstruction, and bronchitis) are generally self-limiting in healthy adults, certain strains such as HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection and febrile seizure, especially in infants, people of advanced age, and immunocompromised hosts. In 2003, a novel HCoV strain was identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that began in Asia in 2002. The strain has hence been referred to as SARS-CoV. In addition, as recently as September 2012, another novel HCoV, human betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012, was identified as being the cause of fever, renal failure, pneumonia, and severe respiratory distress in two patients in the Middle East.

Study design Development and validation of a tool to assess the quality of reporting of health-related articles, and assessment of the quality of these articles in British newspapers. Methods Eight national daily newspapers from the UK were reviewed for 20 days over a 2-month period. All articles reporting newly emerging research pertaining to health in humans were included and reviewed independently by two raters. A descriptive analysis was performed. Subsequently, a quality assessment tool for use by a non-expert was developed and validated to objectively assess the quality of a newspaper article on a health-related topic. Results The quality assessment tool was found to have good internal consistency and inter-rater reliability. The Daily Mail published almost twice as many articles as its nearest rival, The Daily Express, and over eight times as many articles as The Guardian. Articles in The Times were, on average, more than twice as long as those in The Sun and The Daily Telegraph. The highest quality articles were in The Times and The Independent, with the lowest quality articles in The Sun.

We investigated whether the microbiological profiling could be used to differentiate between these two conditions. METHODS: Children up to five years of age, with rAOM (n = 45) or COME (n = 129) and scheduled for tympanostomy tube insertion were enrolled in a prospective study between 2008 and 2009. Middle ear fluids (n = 119) and nasopharyngeal samples (n = 173) were collected during surgery for bacterial culture and PCR analysis to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, and to detect 15 distinct respiratory viruses. RESULTS: The occurrence of bacterial and viral pathogens in middle ear fluids did not significantly differ between patients suffering from rAOM and COME. In both patient cohorts, H. influenzae and rhinovirus were the predominant pathogens in the middle ear and nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal carriage with two or three bacterial pathogens was associated with the presence of bacteria in middle ear fluid (P = 0.04). The great majority of the bacteria isolated from middle ear fluid were genetically identical to nasopharyngeal isolates from the same patient.

To analyse epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the four types of human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) were studied in Guangzhou, southern China. METHODS: Throat swabs (n=4755) were collected and tested from children and adults with ARTI over a 26-month period, and 4447 of 4755 (93.5%) patients’ clinical presentations were recorded for further analysis. RESULTS: Of 4755 patients tested, 178 (3.7%) were positive for HPIV. Ninety-nine (2.1%) samples were positive for HPIV-3, 58 (1.2%) for HPIV-1, 19 (0.4%) for HPIV-2 and 8 (0.2%) for HPIV-4. 160/178 (88.9%) HPIV-positive samples were from paediatric patients younger than 5 years old, but no infant under one month of age was HPIV positive. Seasonal peaks of HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 occurred as autumn turned to winter and summer turned to autumn. HPIV-2 and HPIV-4 were detected less frequently, and their frequency of isolation increased when the frequency of HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 declined. HPIV infection led to a wide spectrum of symptoms, and more “hoarseness” (p=0.015), “abnormal pulmonary breathing sound” (p<0.001), “dyspnoea” (p<0.001), “pneumonia” (p=0.01), and “diarrhoea” (p<0.001) presented in HPIV-positive patients than HPIV-negative patients. 10/10 (100%) HPIV-positive adult patients (≥14 years old) presented with systemic influenza-like symptoms, while 90/164 (54.9%) HPIV-positive paediatric patients (<14 years old) presented with these symptoms (p=0.005). The only significant difference in clinical presentation between HPIV types was “Expectoration” (p<0.001). Co-infections were common, with 33.3%–63.2% of samples positive for the four HPIV types also testing positive for other respiratory pathogens. However, no significant differences were seen in clinical presentation between patients solely infected with HPIV and patients co-infected with HPIV and other respiratory pathogens.

Small molecule activators of KCNQ1/KCNE1 are useful both for understanding the mechanism of the complex activity and for developing therapeutics for LQTs. In this study we report that hexachlorophene (HCP), the active component of the topical anti-infective prescription drug pHisoHex, is a KCNQ1/KCNE1 activator. HCP potently increases the current amplitude of KCNQ1/KCNE1 expressed by stabilizing the channel in an open state with an EC(50) of 4.61±1.29 μM. Further studies in cardiomyocytes showed that HCP significantly shortens the action potential duration at 1 μM.

Recent studies have focused on the potential antitumor activity of lycorine. In our previous study, we found that lycorine decrease the cell viability of leukemia HL-60 cells and multiple myeloma KM3 cells and induces cell apoptosis. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of lycorine on human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells has yet to be determined. METHODS: Human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells K562 were treated with lycorine. Cell viability was monitored using the method of CCK-8. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity was detected by HDAC colorimetric assay, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of cell-cycle related proteins were identified using Western blot. RESULTS: In the present study, we further revealed that lycorine can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells. Analysis of HDAC activity showed that lycroine decreases HDAC enzymatic activities in K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of HDAC activity has been associated with cell-cycle arrest and growth inhibition. We evaluated the cell cycle distribution after lycorine treatment and found that lycorine causes cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. To investigate the mechanism behind this cell cycle arrest, G1-related proteins were assayed by Western blot. After lycorine treatment, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expressions were inhibited and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation was reduced. Lycorine treatment also significantly upregulated the expression of p53 and its target gene product, p21. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that inhibition of HDAC activity is responsible for at least part of the induction of cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by lycorine and provide a mechanistic framework for further exploring the use of lycorine as a novel antitumor agent.",2012-11-23,"Li,Lv;Dai,Hong-Juan;Ye,Mao;Wang,Shu-Ling;Xiao,Xiao-Juan;Zheng,Jie;Chen,Hui-Yong;Luo,Yu-hao;Liu,Jing",CancerCellInt,9341094,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23176676/;https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2867-12-49,13amcxh2,

Among RNA viruses, replication fidelity is recognized as a key determinant of virulence and escape from antiviral therapy; increased fidelity is attenuating for some viruses. Coronavirus replication fidelity is approximately 20-fold greater than that of other RNA viruses and is mediated by a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (ExoN) that likely functions in RNA proofreading. In this study, we demonstrate that engineered inactivation of SARS-CoV ExoN activity results in a stable mutator phenotype with profoundly decreased fidelity in vivo and attenuation of pathogenesis in young, aged, and immunocompromised mouse models of human SARS. The ExoN inactivation genotype and mutator phenotype are stable and do not revert to virulence, even after serial passage or long-term persistent infection in vivo.

Our current understanding of the epidemiology of these infections is limited by reliance on data from decades ago performed using low-sensitivity laboratory methods, and recent studies reporting severe, hospital-managed disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) study is an ongoing study enrolling a dynamic birth cohort to document the community-based epidemiology of viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in early childhood. Women are recruited antenatally, and their healthy newborn is followed for the first 2 years of life. Parents keep a daily symptom diary for the study child, collect a weekly anterior nose swab and dirty nappy swab and complete a burden diary when a child meets pre-defined illness criteria. Specimens will be tested for a wide range of viruses by real-time PCR assays. Primary analyses involves calculating incidence rates for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) for the cohort by age and seasonality. Control material from children when they are without symptoms will allow us to determine what proportion of ARIs and AGE can be attributed to specific pathogens. Secondary analyses will assess the incidence and shedding duration of specific respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens.

We previously identified albumin-associated lipid- and, more specifically, saturated fatty acid-induced transdifferentiation programs in human cancer cells (HCCLs). In this study, we further characterized the adipocyte-like cells, resulting from the transdifferentiation of human cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MALME-3M, and proposed a common mechanistic approach for these transdifferentiating programs. We showed the loss of pigmentation in MALME-3M cells treated with albumin-associated lipids, based on electron microscopic analysis, and the overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) by western blotting in MALME-3M and MCF-7 cells treated with unsaturated fatty acids. Comparing the gene expression profiles of naive melanoma MALME-3M cells and albumin-associated lipid-treated cells, based on RNA sequencing, we confirmed the transcriptional upregulation of some key adipogenic gene markers and also an alternative splicing of the adipogenic master regulator PPARG, that is probably related to the reported up regulated expression of the protein. Most importantly, these results also showed the upregulation of genes responsible for Clathrin (CLTC) and other adaptor-related proteins. An increase in CLTC expression in the transdifferentiated cells was confirmed by western blotting. Inactivation of CLTC by chlorpromazine (CHP), an inhibitor of CTLC mediated endocytosis (CME), and gene silencing by siRNAs, partially reversed the accumulation of neutral lipids observed in the transdifferentiated cells. These findings give a deeper insight into the phenotypic changes observed in HCCL to adipocyte-like transdifferentiation and point towards CME as a key pathway in distinct transdifferentiation programs.

In the context of disease emergence from wildlife, wildlife and habitat should be conserved, which in turn will preserve vital ecosystem structure and function, which has broader implications for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, while simultaneously minimizing the spillover of pathogens from wild animals into human beings.

More than two-thirds of human viruses can also infect non-human hosts, mainly mammals, and sometimes birds. Many specialist human viruses also have mammalian or avian origins. Indeed, a substantial proportion of mammalian viruses may be capable of crossing the species barrier into humans, although only around half of these are capable of being transmitted by humans and around half again of transmitting well enough to cause major outbreaks.

Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of TTSuV1. In this study, synonymous codon usage patterns and the key determinants in the coding region of 29 available complete TTSuV1 genome sequences were examined. By calculating the nucleotide content and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of TTSuV1 coding sequences, we found that the preferentially used codons were mostly those ending with A or C nucleotides; less-used codons were mostly codons ending with U or G nucleotides, and these were mainly affected by composition constraints. Although there was a variation in codon usage bias among different TTSuV1 genomes, the codon usage bias and GC content in the TTSuV1 coding region was lower, which was mainly determined by the base composition in the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. Moreover, the results of correspondence analysis (COA) indicated that the codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 isolated from different countries varied greatly and had significant differences. In addition, Spearman’s rank correlation analysis and an ENC plot revealed that apart from mutation pressure, which was critical in determining the codon usage pattern, other factors were involved in shaping the evolution of codon usage bias in TTSuV1, such as natural selection. Those results suggested that synonymous codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 genomes were the result of interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection.

However, a single donor muscle biopsy is unlikely to provide enough cells to effectively transplant the muscle mass of a patient affected by muscular dystrophy. Expansion of cells ex vivo using traditional culture techniques significantly reduces engraftment potential. We hypothesized that activation of Notch signaling during ex vivo expansion would maintain donor cell engraftment potential. In this study, we expanded freshly isolated canine muscle-derived cells on tissue culture plates coated with Delta-1(ext)-IgG to activate Notch signaling or with human IgG as a control. A model of canine-to-murine xenotransplantation was used to quantitatively compare canine muscle cell engraftment, and determine if engrafted donor cells could function as satellite cells in vivo. We show that Delta-1(ext)-IgG inhibited differentiation of canine muscle-derived cells, and increased the level of genes normally expressed in myogenic precursors. Moreover, cells expanded on Delta-1(ext)-IgG resulted in a significant increase in the number of donor-derived fibers, as compared to cells expanded on human IgG, reaching engraftment levels similar to freshly isolated cells. Importantly, cells expanded on Delta-1(ext)-IgG engrafted to the recipient satellite cell niche, and contributed to further regeneration.

Surveys of T. gondii infection in wild birds have been reported extensively in the world, but little is known of T. gondii infection in peafowls worldwide. This study was performed to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in peafowls in Yunnan Province, southwestern China. METHODS: Sera from 277 peafowls, including 272 blue peafowls (Pavo cristatus) and 5 green peafowls (Pavo muticus) originated from two geographic areas in Yunnan Province were assayed for T. gondii antibodies using the modified agglutination test (MAT). RESULTS: Specific T. gondii antibodies were detected in 35 of 277 (12.64%) peafowls (MAT titer ≥ 1:5). Seropositive birds were found in both species, 33 in 272 blue peafowls and 2 in 5 green peafowls. There was no significant difference in T. gondii seroprevalence between the adolescent birds (6.74%) and the adult birds (6.67%) (P > 0.05). The geographical origins of peafowls was found to be highly associated with T. gondii infection in the present study, a statistically significant difference in T. gondii seropositivity was observed between peafowls from Kunming (31.08%) and those from Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture (5.91%) (OR = 10.956, 95% CI = 1.632-73.545, P = 0.014). Statistical analyses showed that there were no significant interactions between ages and geographical origins of peafowls (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present survey indicated that infection of peafowls with T. gondii is widespread in Yunnan Province, which has significant public health concerns and implications for prevention and control of toxoplamosis in this province.

Conversely, far less attention has been paid to pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife. Here, we focus on the case of game restocking, which implies the release of millions of animals worldwide each year. We conducted a 2-year study in the Camargue (Southern France) to investigate the influence of hand-reared Mallard releases on avian influenza virus dynamics in surrounding wildlife. We sampled Mallards (cloacal swabs) from several game duck facilities in 2009 and 2010 before their release. A very high (99%) infection rate caused by an H10N7 strain was detected in the game bird facility we sampled in 2009. We did not detect this strain in shot ducks we sampled, neither during the 2008/2009 nor the 2009/2010 hunting seasons. In 2010 infection rates ranged from 0 to 24% in hand-reared ducks. The 2009 H10N7 strain was fully sequenced. It results from multiple reassortment events between Eurasian low pathogenic strains. Interestingly, H10N7 strains had previously caused human infections in Egypt and Australia. The H10 and N7 segments we sequenced were clearly distinct from the Australian ones but they belonged to the same large cluster as the Egyptian ones. We did not observe any mutation linked to increased virulence, transmission to mammals, or antiviral resistance in the H10N7 strain we identified. Our results indicate that the potential role of hand-reared Mallards in influenza virus epizootics must be taken into account given the likely risk of viral exchange between game bird facilities and wild habitats, owing to duck rearing conditions.

Here, we use simulated data to test the ability of both parametric and non-parametric methods for inference of effective population size (coded in the popular BEAST package) to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. We consider a range of simulations centred on scenarios considered plausible for pandemic influenza, but our conclusions are generic for any exponentially growing epidemic. We highlight systematic biases in non-parametric effective population size estimation. The most prominent such bias leads to the false inference of slowing of epidemic spread in the recent past even when the real epidemic is growing exponentially. We suggest some sampling strategies that could reduce (but not eliminate) some of the biases. Parametric methods can correct for these biases if the infected population size is large. We also explore how some poor sampling strategies (e.g. that over-represent epidemiologically linked clusters of cases) could dramatically exacerbate bias in an uncontrolled manner. Finally, we present a simple diagnostic indicator, based on coalescent density and which can easily be applied to reconstructed phylogenies, that identifies time-periods for which effective population size estimates are less likely to be biased.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that 263 (96.7%) S. sonnei belonged to 1 clonal genotype A, which were further divided into A1–A6 subtypes. While subtype A2 was dominant in the early stage of study years, subtype A4 started to emerge and increased significantly in later years. Antimicrobial resistance rates are statistically different among the 6 subtypes (P = 0.0000), and A4 possessed the highest resistance rates to ampicillin (83.7%) and piperacillin (81.4%). Subtype A3 was highly clustered in inpatients compared to other subtypes (P = 0.0145).

However, comprehensive studies of the viral aetiology of ALRI have not been conducted in PNG for almost 30 years. OBJECTIVES: To determine the viruses associated with ALRI among children living in the PNG highlands using sensitive molecular detection techniques. STUDY DESIGN: Pernasal swabs were collected routinely between 1 week and 18 months of age and also during episodes of ALRI, as part of a neonatal pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial. A tandem multiplex real-time PCR assay was used to test for a comprehensive range of respiratory viruses in samples collected from 221 young children. Picornavirus typing was supported by DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: Recognized pathogenic respiratory viruses were detected in 198/273 (73%) samples collected from children with no evidence of ALRI and 69/80 (86%) samples collected during ALRI episodes. Human rhinoviruses (HRV) species A, B and C were detected in 152 (56%) samples from non-ALRI children and 50 (63%) samples collected during ALRI episodes. Partial structural region sequences for two new species C rhinoviruses were added to the GenBank database. ALRI was associated with detection of adenovirus species B (p < 0.01) or C (p < 0.05), influenza A (p < 0.0001) or respiratory syncytial virus (p < 0.0001). Multiple viruses were detected more often during ALRI episodes (49%) than when children displayed no symptoms of ALRI (18%) (p < 0.0001).

Gene therapy has the potential to meet this goal and the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) has lead to a new class of highly selective therapeutics. However, initial enthusiasm is reduced due to safety concerns associated with virus-based delivery vectors that are used for in vivo delivery. Viral vectors for siRNA delivery into target cells are used because of their high target specificity and delivery efficacy (endosomal escape). Recent discoveries suggest that a specialized form of nano-sized lipid vesicles called exosomes can incorporate and transport functional RNAs into target cells and may serve as an attractive alternative. Evidence is accumulating that most pluricellular organisms sustain exosome-based communications via inter-cellular exchange of mRNA and miRNAs between cells. We discovered that viruses have found ways to exploit this communication pathway and we argue here that adaptations of exosomes imposed by viruses maybe exploited for superior delivery of RNA in vivo.

Understanding the genes that control tolerance and resistance could provide new strategies to improve the health and welfare of livestock. Around one sixth of the world cattle population is estimated to be at risk from one of the most debilitating tick-borne diseases of cattle, caused by the protozoan parasite, Theileria annulata. The parasite mainly infects cells of the myeloid lineage which are also the main producers of inflammatory cytokines. If an infectious or inflammatory insult is sufficiently great, inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages enter the circulation and induce an acute phase proteins (APP) response. The Bos taurus Holstein breed produces higher and more prolonged levels of inflammatory cytokine induced APP than the Bos indicus Sahiwal breed in response to experimental infection with T. annulata. The Sahiwal exhibits significantly less pathology and survives infection, unlike the Holstein breed. Therefore, we hypothesised that the causal genes were likely to be expressed in macrophages and control the production of inflammatory cytokines. A functional genomics approach revealed that the transcriptome profile of the B. taurus macrophages was more associated with an inflammatory programme than the B. indicus macrophages. In particular the most differentially expressed gene was a member of the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) family. These are mainly expressed on myeloid cell surfaces and control inflammatory responses. Other differentially expressed genes included bovine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (BoLA) class II genes, particularly BoLA DQ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)B2. We are now exploring whether sequence and functional differences in the bovine SIRP family may underlie the resistance or tolerance to T. annulata between the breeds. Potentially, our research may also have more general implications for the control of inflammatory processes against other pathogens. Genes controlling the balance between pathology and protection may determine how livestock can survive in the face of infectious onslaught.

There have been different names for the greater China area, such as ‘the Chinese circle’, ‘the Chinese community’, ‘the greater China community’, ‘China economic circle’, ‘Chinese economic area’, ‘China economic zone’, and so on. Probably first used by George Cressey at least as far back as the 1930s, the term ‘Greater China’ was to refer to the entire Chinese empire, as opposed to China proper (Harding, 1993, p. 660). The term ‘Greater China’ is now generally used for referring to the cultural and economic ties between the relevant territories, and is not intended to imply sovereignty. Sometimes, to avoid any political connotation, the term Chinese-speaking world is often used instead of the Greater China. Despite the common historical, cultural, and linguistic homogeneity, the greater China economic area has followed different routes of economic developments. Hong Kong and Macau have been under the colonial administrations of the UK and of Portugal, respectively. Taiwan was a Japanese colony between 1895 and 1945 and, following a short period of reunification with mainland China, has been operating independently from the rest of the world. As a result, significant social and economic differences have been present in the four parts of the area, especially since 1949. The Taiwan Strait became a forbidden boundary in 1949 when the Nationalist-led government fled to Taiwan and, at the same time, the Communist-led government was founded on the mainland. Since then, Taiwan and mainland China have been two divergent regimes. Against the common cultural and linguistic homogeneity, mainland China chose essentially to pursue a socialist line, while Taiwan followed the route of market-oriented capitalism. Furthermore, the two sides have also treated each other antagonistically, particularly during the high tide of military confrontation, when the mainland claimed that it would liberate the Taiwan compatriots from the black society sooner or later, while in turn Taiwan maintained that they would use the ‘three democratisms’ to reoccupy the mainland eventually. The Chinese people have a long history of migrating overseas. One of the migrations dates back to the Ming dynasty when Zheng He (1371–1435) became the envoy of the Ming emperor. He sent people – many of them Cantonese and Hokkien – to explore and trade in the South China Sea and in the Indian Ocean. Different waves of immigration led to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Southeast Asia, North America, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America, South Africa, and Russia. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Western Europe). Many of these emigrants were themselves overseas Chinese or were from Taiwan or Hong Kong, particularly from the 1950s to the 1970s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America, and the other parts of the world. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.

Here, we report the identification of Sec16A and p115, two proteins of the ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport system, as novel components of the TRAF3 interactome network. Notably, in non-infected cells, TRAF3 was found associated with markers of the ER-Exit-Sites (ERES), ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis-Golgi apparatus. Upon dsRNA and dsDNA sensing however, the Golgi apparatus fragmented into cytoplasmic punctated structures containing TRAF3 allowing its colocalization and interaction with Mitochondrial AntiViral Signaling (MAVS), the essential mitochondria-bound RIG-I-like Helicase (RLH) adaptor. In contrast, retention of TRAF3 at the ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport system blunted the ability of TRAF3 to interact with MAVS upon viral infection and consequently decreased type I IFN response. Moreover, depletion of Sec16A and p115 led to a drastic disorganization of the Golgi paralleled by the relocalization of TRAF3, which under these conditions was unable to associate with MAVS. Consequently, upon dsRNA and dsDNA sensing, ablation of Sec16A and p115 was found to inhibit IRF3 activation and anti-viral gene expression. Reciprocally, mild overexpression of Sec16A or p115 in Hec1B cells increased the activation of IFNβ, ISG56 and NF-κB -dependent promoters following viral infection and ectopic expression of MAVS and Tank-binding kinase-1 (TBK1). In line with these results, TRAF3 was found enriched in immunocomplexes composed of p115, Sec16A and TBK1 upon infection. Hence, we propose a model where dsDNA and dsRNA sensing induces the formation of membrane-bound compartments originating from the Golgi, which mediate the dynamic association of TRAF3 with MAVS leading to an optimal induction of innate immune responses.",2012-07-05,"vanZuylen,WendyJ.;Doyon,Priscilla;Clément,Jean-François;Khan,KashifAziz;D'Ambrosio,LisaM.;Dô,Florence;St-Amant-Verret,Myriam;Wissanji,Tasheen;Emery,Gregory;Gingras,Anne-Claude;Meloche,Sylvain;Servant,MarcJ.",PLoSPathog,2783395,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22792062/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002747,1m5dbwjv,

In PTX3wild type mice, MHV -1 induced PTX3 expression in the lung and serum in a time dependent manner. MHV-1 infection led to acute lung injury with greater severity in PTX3 deficient mice than that in wild type mice. PTX3 deficiency enhanced early infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung. PTX3 bound to MHV-1 and MHV-3 and reduced MHV-1 infectivity in vitro.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled adult patients presenting with influenzalike illness to the Emergency Department at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from January 28, 2011, through April 30, 2011. Patients self-collected a midturbinate nasal flocked swab from their right nostril following written instructions. A second swab was then collected by an HCW from the left nostril. Swabs were tested for influenza A and B viruses by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and percent concordance between collection methods was determined. RESULTS: Of the 72 paired specimens analyzed, 25 were positive for influenza A or B RNA by at least one of the collection methods (34.7% positivity rate). When the 14 patients who had prior health care training were excluded, the qualitative agreement between collection methods was 94.8% (55 of 58). Two of the 58 specimens (3.4%) from patients without health care training were positive only by HCW collection, and 1 of 58 (1.7%) was positive only by patient self-collection.

The gammacoronaviruses primarily infect avian hosts. Within this genus of coronaviruses, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly infectious upper-respiratory tract disease in commercial poultry. IBV shows rapid evolution in chickens, frequently producing new antigenic types, which adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect. Rapid evolution in IBV is facilitated by strong selection, large population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts, and transmission bottlenecks between hosts. Genetic diversity within a host arises primarily by mutation, which includes substitutions, insertions and deletions. Mutations are caused both by the high error rate, and limited proof reading capability, of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, and by recombination. Recombination also generates new haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants.

We showed a clear unwinding lag with increasing length of the double-stranded region of the nucleic acid, suggesting the presence of intermediates in the unwinding process. To elucidate the nature of the intermediates we carried out transient kinetic analysis of the nsp13 helicase activity. We demonstrated that the enzyme unwinds nucleic acid in discrete steps of 9.3 base-pairs (bp) each, with a catalytic rate of 30 steps per second. Therefore the net unwinding rate is ∼280 base-pairs per second. We also showed that nsp12, the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), enhances (2-fold) the catalytic efficiency of nsp13 by increasing the step size of nucleic acid (RNA/RNA or DNA/DNA) unwinding. This effect is specific for SARS-CoV nsp12, as no change in nsp13 activity was observed when foot-and-mouth-disease virus RdRp was used in place of nsp12.

Temporary migrant workers have been labeled as the major driving force for the rising incidence of infectious diseases in cities. However, it has not been well recognized that temporary migration indeed may have tremendous impacts on the spread of infectious diseases in migrants' home villages. In this paper, by proposing a delay differential equation model, we provide a framework to study the influence of temporary migration on the transmission of infectious diseases in a migrant workers' home village. The model is shown to admit a unique positive equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable and is globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. This implies that the disease always persists at a constant level. Considering tuberculosis as an example, we explore various disease prevention and control strategies numerically to demonstrate how migration related parameters affect the early outbreak of the disease. We find that a single control strategy, such as reducing the migration time period alone, has little effect on reducing the disease endemic level. For disease prevention and control, temporary migrant workers should be identified as the top target group, and a combination of several prevention strategies should be implemented.",2012-05-07,"Wang,Lin;Wang,Xiao",JournalofTheoreticalBiology,11750049,True,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.01.004;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519312000057;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519312000057;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22266046/,1v6lcti6,

The human Corona virus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) causes only limited CPE on different cell lines (Schildgen et al., 2006). Following infection of Vero118 cells, virus-induced CPE was too low to allow readout based on classical colorimetric methods (such as the MTS assay), even following prolonged incubation times (>7 days). To develop an antiviral screenings-assay against HCoV-NL63, we explored whether a dead-cell protease substrate could be used instead. The substrate used is a quenched peptide (bis-AAF-R110) that releases a fluorophore upon proteolytic-cleavage by proteases; the latter released from dead cells. Following different rounds of optimization a screening protocol was developed: Vero118 cells in 96-well plate format were infected with HCoV-NL63 (MOI = 0.01; 200 μL cell culture; 2.10(4) cells/mL, IMDM 5% FBS medium). Cultures were subsequently incubated for 5 days at 35 °C after which 20 μL of the peptide solution was added. Fluorescence was quantitated 2 hr after incubation at 37 °C. A roughly 3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in the infected cultures was observed as compared to the uninfected cultures with a low well-to-well variability.

An anti-ACE2 polyclonal antiserum (that prevents coronavirus infection in cell cultures) was used as a positive control and allowed to validate the assay for antiviral screening purposes.

However, when activated microglia assume diverse phenotypes ranging from fully inflamed, which involves the release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, to alternatively activated, releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines or neurotrophins, the consequences to neurons can range from detrimental to supportive. Due to the different experimental sets and conditions, contradictory results have been obtained regarding the controversial question of whether microglia are “good” or “bad.” While it is well understood that the dual roles of activated microglia depend on specific situations, the underlying mechanisms have remained largely unclear, and the interpretation of certain findings related to diverse microglial phenotypes continues to be problematic.

Given the large number of cellular targets for SUMO addition and the breadth of critical cellular processes that are regulated via sumoylation, viral modulation of overall sumoylation presumably alters the cellular environment to ensure that it is favorable for viral reproduction and/or persistence.

Given the genetic diversity of respiratory viruses and the emergence of drug resistant strains, the targeted disruption of human host-virus interactions is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating multi-viral infections. The availability of large-scale genomic datasets focused on host-pathogen interactions can be used to discover novel drug targets as well as potential opportunities for drug repositioning. METHODS/RESULTS: In this study, we performed a large-scale analysis of microarray datasets involving host response to infections by influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, SARS-coronavirus, metapneumonia virus, coxsackievirus and cytomegalovirus. Common genes and pathways were found through a rigorous, iterative analysis pipeline where relevant host mRNA expression datasets were identified, analyzed for quality and gene differential expression, then mapped to pathways for enrichment analysis. Possible repurposed drugs targets were found through database and literature searches. A total of 67 common biological pathways were identified among the seven different respiratory viruses analyzed, representing fifteen laboratories, nine different cell types, and seven different array platforms. A large overlap in the general immune response was observed among the top twenty of these 67 pathways, adding validation to our analysis strategy. Of the top five pathways, we found 53 differentially expressed genes affected by at least five of the seven viruses. We suggest five new therapeutic indications for existing small molecules or biological agents targeting proteins encoded by the genes F3, IL1B, TNF, CASP1 and MMP9. Pathway enrichment analysis also identified a potential novel host response, the Parkin-Ubiquitin Proteasomal System (Parkin-UPS) pathway, which is known to be involved in the progression of neurodegenerative Parkinson's disease.

Although increasing evidence points to T cell immunity playing a critical role in vaccination against viral diseases, vaccine efficacy is mostly associated with the induction of antibody responses. Here we analyze the immunological mechanism(s) of rapidly protective vaccinia virus immunization using mousepox as surrogate model for human smallpox. We found that fast protection against lethal systemic poxvirus disease solely depended on CD4 and CD8 T cell responses induced by vaccination with highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) or conventional vaccinia virus. Of note, CD4 T cells were critically required to allow for MVA induced CD8 T cell expansion and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity was a key mechanism of MVA induced protection. In contrast, selected components of the innate immune system and B cell-mediated responses were fully dispensable for prevention of fatal disease by immunization given two days before challenge. In conclusion, our data clearly demonstrate that perforin-dependent CD8 T cell immunity plays a key role in MVA conferred short term protection against lethal mousepox.

Some researchers believe that interactions between HIV-1 Gag-Pol molecules trigger the activation of embedded PR (which mediates Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage), and that Gag-Pol assembly domains outside of PR may contribute to PR activation by influencing PR dimer interaction in a Gag-Pol context. To determine if the enhancement of PR dimer interaction facilitates PR activation, we placed single or tandem repeat leucine zippers (LZ) at the PR C-terminus, and looked for a correlation between enhanced Gag processing efficiency and increased Gag-PR-LZ multimerization capacity. We found significant reductions in virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by HIV-1 mutants, with LZ fused to the end of PR as a result of enhanced Gag cleavage efficiency. Since VLP production can be restored to wt levels following PR activity inhibition, this assembly defect is considered PR activity-dependent. We also found a correlation between the LZ enhancement effect on Gag cleavage and enhanced Gag-PR multimerization. The results suggest that PR dimer interactions facilitated by forced Gag-PR multimerization lead to premature Gag cleavage, likely a result of premature PR activation. Our conclusion is that placement of a heterologous dimerization domain downstream of PR enhances PR-mediated Gag cleavage efficiency, implying that structural conformation, rather than the primary sequence outside of PR, is a major determinant of HIV-1 PR activation.",2012-03-01,"Pan,Yen-Yu;Wang,Shiu-Mei;Huang,Kuo-Jung;Chiang,Chien-Cheng;Wang,Chin-Tien",PLoSOne,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291649/,09locmnw,

Their activation can elicit a strong humoral and cellular immune response as well as mucosal immunity. Therefore, the skin is a very attractive site for vaccination, and an intradermal application of antigen may be much more effective than a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. However, the stratum corneum (SC) is a most effective barrier against the invasion of topically applied vaccines. Products which have reached the stage of clinical testing, avoid this problem by injecting the nano‐vaccine intradermally or by employing a barrier disrupting method and applying the vaccine to a relatively large skin area. Needle‐free vaccination is desirable from a number of aspects: ease of application, improved patient acceptance and less risk of infection among them. Nanocarriers can be designed in a way that they can overcome the SC. Also incorporation into nanocarriers protects instable antigen from degradation, improves uptake and processing by APCs, and facilitates endosomal escape and nuclear delivery of DNA vaccines. In addition, sustained release systems may build a depot in the tissue gradually releasing antigen which may avoid booster doses. Therefore, nanoformulations of vaccines for transcutaneous immunization are currently a very dynamic field of research.

On epithelial cells, we recently demonstrated that TIM-1 serves as a receptor for this family of viruses, but the cell surface receptors in other cell types remain unidentified. Upon receptor binding, the virus is internalized into endosomes primarily via macropinocytosis, but perhaps by other mechanisms as well. Within the acidified endosome, the heavily glycosylated GP(1) is cleaved to a smaller form by the low pH-dependent cellular proteases Cathepsin L and B, exposing residues in the receptor binding site (RBS). Details of the molecular events following cathepsin-dependent trimming of GP(1) are currently incomplete; however, the processed GP(1) specifically interacts with endosomal/lysosomal membranes that contain the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) protein and expression of NPC1 is required for productive infection, suggesting that GP/NPC1 interactions may be an important late step in the entry process. Additional events such as further GP(1) processing and/or reducing events may also be required to generate a fusion-ready form of the glycoprotein. Once this has been achieved, sequences in the filovirus GP(2) subunit mediate viral/cellular membrane fusion via mechanisms similar to those previously described for other enveloped viruses. This multi-step entry pathway highlights the complex and highly orchestrated path of internalization and fusion that appears unique for filoviruses.",2012-02-07,"Hunt,CatherineL.;Lennemann,NicholasJ.;Maury,Wendy",Viruses,1558172,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22470835/;https://doi.org/10.3390/v4020258,1j9zmuub,

Recently, other animals such as pigs and some species of fruit bats have also been shown to be susceptible to these viruses. While having a preference for some cell types such as hepatocytes, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages, filoviruses are known to be pantropic in infection of primates. The envelope glycoprotein (GP) is responsible for both receptor binding and fusion of the virus envelope with the host cell membrane. It has been demonstrated that filovirus GP interacts with multiple molecules for entry into host cells, whereas none of the cellular molecules so far identified as a receptor/co-receptor fully explains filovirus tissue tropism and host range. Available data suggest that the mucin-like region (MLR) on GP plays an important role in attachment to the preferred target cells, whose infection is likely involved in filovirus pathogenesis, whereas the MLR is not essential for the fundamental function of the GP in viral entry into cells in vitro.

In recent years, an integrated model has emerged, where the CDC remains the basic management unit for TB control, while a general hospital is designated to provide clinical care for TB patients. This study aims to explore the factors that influence the integration of TB services in general hospitals and generate knowledge to aid the scale-up of integration of TB services in China. METHODS: This study adopted a qualitative approach using interviews from sites in East and West China. Analysis was conducted using a thematic framework approach. RESULTS: The more prosperous site in East China was more coordinated and thus had a better method of resource allocation and more patient-orientated service, compared with the poorer site in the West. The development of public health organizations appeared to influence how effectively integration occurred. An understanding from staff that hospitals had better capacity to treat TB patients than CDCs was a strong rationale for integration. However, the economic and political interests might act as a barrier to effective integration. Both sites shared the same challenges of attracting and retaining a skilled workforce for the TB services. The role of the health bureau was more directive in the Western site, while a more participatory and collaborative approach was adopted in the Eastern site. CONCLUSION: The process of integration identifies similarities and differences between sites in more affluent East China and poorer West China. Integration of TB services in the hospitals needs to address the challenges of stakeholder motivations and resource allocation.

The induction of antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune response at the site of virus entry is a major challenge for vaccine design. Here, we designed a strategy for noninvasive receptor mediated gene delivery to nasal resident DCs. The pDNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using a complex coacervation process and characterized for size, shape, surface charge, plasmid DNA loading and protection against nuclease digestion. The pDNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were targeted with bifunctional fusion protein (bfFp) vector for achieving DC selective targeting. The bfFp is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of truncated core-streptavidin fused with anti-DEC-205 single chain antibody (scFv). The core-streptavidin arm of fusion protein binds with biotinylated nanoparticles, while anti-DEC-205 scFv imparts targeting specificity to DC DEC-205 receptor. We demonstrate that intranasal administration of bfFp targeted formulations along with anti-CD40 DC maturation stimuli enhanced magnitude of mucosal IgA as well as systemic IgG against N protein. The strategy led to the detection of augmented levels of N protein specific systemic IgG and nasal IgA antibodies. However, following intranasal delivery of naked pDNA no mucosal and systemic immune responses were detected. A parallel comparison of targeted formulations using intramuscular and intranasal routes showed that the intramuscular route is superior for induction of systemic IgG responses compared with the intranasal route.

Drak2-/- T cells failed to reject allogeneic tumors, and were defective in rejecting Balb/C allogeneic skin grafts on C57BL6/J recipients. A significant fraction of alloreactive Drak2-/- T cells underwent apoptosis following activation, whereas enforced expression of Bcl-xL in Drak2-/- T cells restored allograft rejection. Formation of allogeneic memory was also greatly hampered in T cells lacking the Drak2 gene. Adoptive transfer of memory T cells from Drak2-/- mice failed to promote the rejection of allogeneic tumors, and such cells led to significantly delayed rejection of skin allografts in the Balb/C->C57BL/6J model. Costimulatory blockade by in vivo administration of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) synergized with the DRAK2 deficiency and led to long-term allogeneic skin graft acceptance. Overall, these results demonstrate that DRAK2 plays an important role in primary and memory T cell responsiveness to allografts.

This is even more important, as bats with their capability of long distance dispersal and complex social structures are unique in the way microbes could be spread by these mammalian species. Nevertheless, infection studies in bats are predominantly limited to the identification of specific pathogens presenting a potential health threat to humans. But the impact of infectious agents on the individual host and their importance on bat mortality is largely unknown and has been neglected in most studies published to date. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Between 2002 and 2009, 486 deceased bats of 19 European species (family Vespertilionidae) were collected in different geographic regions in Germany. Most animals represented individual cases that have been incidentally found close to roosting sites or near human habitation in urban and urban-like environments. The bat carcasses were subjected to a post-mortem examination and investigated histo-pathologically, bacteriologically and virologically. Trauma and disease represented the most important causes of death in these bats. Comparative analysis of pathological findings and microbiological results show that microbial agents indeed have an impact on bats succumbing to infectious diseases, with fatal bacterial, viral and parasitic infections found in at least 12% of the bats investigated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate the importance of diseases and infectious agents as cause of death in European bat species.

The 10-year Cultural Revolution from 1966 brought many hardships, but also clinical care and continuing public health programs to the masses through community-funded medical schemes and the establishment of community-based health workers. These people-focused approaches broke down with China’s market reforms from 1980. Village doctors turned to private practice as community funding ceased, and the attention paid to rural public health declined. CDC relied on vertical programs, some of them successful (such as elimination of lymphatic filariasis and child immunisation), but others (such as control of schistosomiasis and tuberculosis) demonstrating only intermittent progress due to failed strategies or reliance on support by the poorest governments and health workers, who could not or would not collaborate. In addition, China’s laissez-faire approach to public health placed it at great risk, as evidenced by the outbreak in 2003 of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Since then, major changes to disease reporting, the priority given to CDC including through major new domestic resources and reform of China’s health system offer encouragement for CDC. While decentralized funding and varying quality diagnosis, reporting and treatment of infectious diseases remain major challenges, national priority on CDC in China is high.",2011-12-27,"Hipgrave,David",JGlobHealth,14438373,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23198121/,0b7aui02,

Successive reinfection of individuals over a short time interval has been explicitly reported during past pandemics. However, the causes of rapid reinfection and the role of reinfection in driving multiple-wave outbreaks remain poorly understood. To investigate these issues, we focus on a two-wave influenza A/H3N2 epidemic that occurred on the remote island of Tristan da Cunha in 1971. Over 59 days, 273 (96%) of 284 islanders experienced at least one attack and 92 (32%) experienced two attacks. We formulate six mathematical models invoking a variety of antigenic and immunological reinfection mechanisms. Using a maximum-likelihood analysis to confront model predictions with the reported incidence time series, we demonstrate that only two mechanisms can be retained: some hosts with either a delayed or deficient humoral immune response to the primary influenza infection were reinfected by the same strain, thus initiating the second epidemic wave. Both mechanisms are supported by previous empirical studies and may arise from a combination of genetic and ecological causes. We advocate that a better understanding and account of heterogeneity in the human immune response are essential to analysis of multiple-wave influenza outbreaks and pandemic planning.",2011-12-22,"Camacho,Anton;Ballesteros,Sébastien;Graham,AndreaL.;Carrat,Fabrice;Ratmann,Oliver;Cazelles,Bernard",ProcBiolSci,1473892,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.0300;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21525058/,12y420k8,

Organic materials have proved to be among the best candidates for this aim owing to many properties, such as the synthesis tunability, processing, softness and self-assembling ability, which allow them to form surfaces that are compatible with biological tissues. This review reports some research results obtained in the development of devices which exploit organic materials’ properties in order to detect biologically significant molecules as well as to trigger/capture signals from the biological environment. Among the many investigated sensing devices, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and microcantilevers (MCLs) have been chosen. The main factors motivating this choice are their label-free detection approach, which is particularly important when addressing complex biological processes, as well as the possibility to integrate them in an electronic circuit. Particular attention is paid to the design and realization of biocompatible surfaces which can be employed in the recognition of pertinent molecules as well as to the research of new materials, both natural and inspired by nature, as a first approach to environmentally friendly electronics.

Human MBL also bound to DENV and neutralized infection of all four DENV serotypes through complement activation-dependent and -independent pathways. Experiments with human serum from naïve individuals with inherent variation in the levels of MBL in blood showed a direct correlation between the concentration of MBL and neutralization of DENV; samples with high levels of MBL in blood neutralized DENV more efficiently than those with lower levels.

Bayesian haplotype reconstructions and median joining networks revealed haplotype sharing between Bos taurus taurus and Bos taurus indicus breeds at every locus, and specialized beef and dairy breeds could not be differentiated despite an average polymorphism density of 1 marker/158 bp. Collectively, 160 tagSNPs and two tag insertion-deletion mutations (indels) were sufficient to predict 100% of the variation at 280 variable sites for both Bos subspecies and their hybrids, whereas 118 tagSNPs and 1 tagIndel predictively captured 100% of the variation at 235 variable sites for B. t. taurus.

METHODS: Between 2007 January to 2010 January, two hundred and nine internal medicine PGY1 residents completed DOPS, IM-ITE(®) and small-scale OSCE at our hospital. Faculty members completed 12-item 360-degree evaluation for each of the PGY(1) residents regularly. RESULTS: The small-scale OSCE scores correlated well with the 360-degree evaluation scores (r = 0.37, p < 0.021).

Their 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), which catalyzes the proteolytic processing of the polyproteins for viral replication, is a potential target for anti-coronaviral infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we profiled the substrate specificities of 3CL(pro) from human CoV NL63 (group 1), human CoV OC43 (group 2a), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (group 2b) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (group 3), by measuring their activity against a substrate library of 19×8 of variants with single substitutions at P5 to P3' positions. The results were correlated with structural properties like side chain volume, hydrophobicity, and secondary structure propensities of substituting residues. All 3CL(pro) prefer Gln at P1 position, Leu at P2 position, basic residues at P3 position, small hydrophobic residues at P4 position, and small residues at P1' and P2' positions. Despite 3CL(pro) from different groups of CoVs share many similarities in substrate specificities, differences in substrate specificities were observed at P4 positions, with IBV 3CL(pro) prefers P4-Pro and SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) prefers P4-Val. By combining the most favorable residues at P3 to P5 positions, we identified super-active substrate sequences ‘VARLQ↓SGF’ that can be cleaved efficiently by all 3CL(pro) with relative activity of 1.7 to 3.2, and ‘VPRLQ↓SGF’ that can be cleaved specifically by IBV 3CL(pro) with relative activity of 4.3. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The comprehensive substrate specificities of 3CL(pro) from each of the group 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 CoVs have been profiled in this study, which may provide insights into a rational design of broad-spectrum peptidomimetic inhibitors targeting the proteases.",2011-11-02,"Chuck,Chi-Pang;Chow,Hak-Fun;Wan,DavidChi-Cheong;Wong,Kam-Bo",PLoSOne,11720945,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22073294/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0027228,0vu7bobr,

ZEBOV primarily targets mononuclear phagocytes, which are activated upon infection and secrete mediators believed to trigger initial stages of pathogenesis. The characterization of the responses of target cells to ZEBOV infection may therefore not only further understanding of pathogenesis but also suggest possible points of therapeutic intervention. Gene expression profiles of primary human macrophages exposed to ZEBOV were determined using DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR to gain insight into the cellular response immediately after cell entry. Significant changes in mRNA concentrations encoding for 88 cellular proteins were observed. Most of these proteins have not yet been implicated in ZEBOV infection. Some, however, are inflammatory mediators known to be elevated during the acute phase of disease in the blood of ZEBOV-infected humans. Interestingly, the cellular response occurred within the first hour of Ebola virion exposure, i.e. prior to virus gene expression. This observation supports the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) is the primary stimulus for an initial response. Indeed, ZEBOV virions, LPS, and virus-like particles consisting of only the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 and GP(1,2) (VLP(VP40-GP)) triggered comparable responses in macrophages, including pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signals. In contrast, VLP(VP40) (particles lacking GP(1,2)) caused an aberrant response.

We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of DNA encoding H5 as a priming vaccine to improve antibody responses to inactivated influenza vaccination. METHODS: In VRC 306 and VRC 310, two sequentially enrolled phase 1, open-label, randomised clinical trials, healthy adults (age 18–60 years) were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular H5 DNA (4 mg) at day 0 or twice, at day 0 and week 4, followed by H5N1 monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV; 90 μg) at 4 or 24 weeks, and compared with a two-dose regimen of H5N1 MIV with either a 4 or 24 week interval. Antibody responses were assessed by haemagglutination inhibition (HAI), ELISA, neutralisation (ID(80)), and immunoassays for stem-directed antibodies. T cell responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. After enrolment, investigators and individuals were not masked to group assignment. VRC 306 and VRC 310 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00776711 and NCT01086657, respectively. FINDINGS: In VRC 306, 60 individuals were randomly assigned to the four groups (15 in each) and 59 received the vaccinations. In VRC 310, of the 21 individuals enrolled, 20 received the vaccinations (nine received a two-dose regimen of H5N1 MIV and 11 received H5 DNA at day 0 followed by H5N1 MIV at week 24). H5 DNA priming was safe and enhanced H5-specific antibody titres following an H5N1 MIV boost, especially when the interval between DNA prime and MIV boost was extended to 24 weeks. In the two studies, DNA priming with a 24-week MIV boost interval induced protective HAI titres in 21 (81%) of 26 of individuals, with an increase in geometric mean titre (GMT) of more than four times that of individuals given the MIV-MIV regimen at 4 or 24 weeks (GMT 103–206 vs GMT 27–33). Additionally, neutralising antibodies directed to the conserved stem region of H5 were induced by this prime-boost regimen in several individuals. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. INTERPRETATION: DNA priming 24 weeks in advance of influenza vaccine boosting increased the magnitude of protective antibody responses (HAI) and in some cases induced haemagglutinin-stem-specific neutralising antibodies. A DNA-MIV vaccine regimen could enhance the efficacy of H5 or other influenza vaccines and shows that anti-stem antibodies can be elicited by vaccination in man.

(2011) Report of the ‘Mechanisms of lung injury and immunomodulator interventions in influenza’ workshop, 21 March 2010, Ventura, California, USA*. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 5(6), 453–e475. The clinical course of influenza and the extent of lung injury are determined by both viral and host factors, as well as sometimes secondary bacterial infections and exacerbations of underlying conditions. The balance between viral replication and the host immune responses is central to disease pathogenesis, and the extent of lung injury in severe influenza infections may be due in part to overly exuberant or dysregulated innate inflammatory responses or sometimes deficient responses. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the principal cause of respiratory failure associated with severe influenza. ARDS can be triggered by both direct lung insults (e.g. respiratory pathogens) and systemic insults (e.g. sepsis), and the lung damage is exacerbated by the inflammatory response associated with either infectious or non‐infectious insults. This workshop aimed to review the current understanding of lung injury in acute influenza and describe cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung injury that are common to influenza and infections by other respiratory pathogens. In addition, therapeutic agents that target host response proteins and pathways were identified and investigational agents in development reviewed. A logical strategy would be to combine antiviral treatment with drugs that modify excessive host responses or supplement deficient ones. However, a better understanding of common cell signalling pathways associated with acute lung injury caused by influenza and other pathogens is necessary to understand immunopathologic causes of lung injury. This will help determine which immunomodulatory interventions might be useful, and to predict the appropriate timing and consequences of their use.",2011-08-17,"Howard,WendyA.;Peiris,Malik;Hayden,FrederickG.",InfluenzaOtherRespirViruses,46857749,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21848616/;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00278.x,0k2hmjwm,

Results indicated a strong association between asthma admission rate and influenza (r = 0.80, p < 0.05) and SO(2) level (r = 0.73, p < 0.05) in Taiwan in the period 2001–2008. No significant correlation was found for asthma admission and PM(10), O(3), NO(2), and CO. The proposed fluctuation analysis provides a simple correlation exponent describing the complex interactions of respiratory viruses and air pollutants with asthma. This study revealed that there was a 95% probability of having exceeded 2987 asthma admissions per 100,000 population. It was unlikely (30% probability) that the asthma admission rate exceeded 3492 per 100,000 population. The probability of asthma admission risk can be limited to below 50% by keeping the correlation exponent of influenza to below 0.9. We concluded that fluctuation analysis based risk assessment provides a novel predictor of asthma incidence.",2011-08-15,"Liao,Chung-Min;Hsieh,Nan-Hung;Chio,Chia-Pin",SciTotalEnviron,205090314,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969711005237;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.04.056;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969711005237;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21663946/,069keqh8,

In this paper, a versatile numerical method to determine the pollutant distribution of ventilation system with recirculation at steady state is proposed based on typical ventilation systems with accessibility of supply air (ASA) and accessibility of contaminant source (ACS). The relationship is established between contaminant concentrations of supply air and return air in a ventilated room or zone. The concentrations of supply air and contaminant distribution in each room can be determined using such parameters as ASA and ACS. The proposed method is validated by both experimental data and numerical simulation result. The computing speed of the proposed method is compared with the iteration method.

As such, prolonged glial activation, as is thought to occur during a persistent viral infection of the CNS, may contribute to both neurodegeneration and demyelination. However, the effects of virus-induced glial activation on oligodendrocytes are not fully understood. METHOD: To determine the effects of glial activation on oligodendrocyte viability we treated primary glial cultures isolated from neonatal rats or mice with the RNA viral mimic poly(I:C) and in some cases other TLR ligands. TLR3 expression was determined by western blot. Cytokine levels were measured by RT-PCR, ELISA, and intracellular cytokine staining. Oligodendrocyte precursor (preOL) viability was determined by Alamar blue assays and immunocytochemistry. RESULT: Stimulation of mixed glial cultures with poly(I:C) resulted in microglia activation, TNFα production and preOL toxicity. This toxic effect of poly(I:C) was indirect as it failed to affect preOL viability in pure cultures despite the fact that preOLs express TLR3. Poly(I:C)-induced loss of preOLs was abolished in TNFα or TNFR1 deficient mixed glial cultures, suggesting that TNFα/TNFR1 signaling is required for poly(I:C) toxicity. Furthermore, although both microglia and astrocytes express functional TLR3, only microglia produced TNFα in culture. Consistent with these findings, other TLR agonists similarly triggered TNFα production and preOL toxicity in mixed glial cultures. CONCLUSION: Activation of microglia by poly(I:C) promotes TNFα/TNFR1-dependent oligodendroglial cell death. These data indicate that during an ongoing viral infection of the CNS, microglial TNFα may be detrimental to oligodendrocytes.",2011-08-03,"Steelman,AndrewJ;Li,Jianrong",JNeuroinflammation,8592389,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-8-89;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21812954/,16032h3d,

These viruses are transmitted to humans through contact with their respective South American rodent hosts. Each uses human transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as its obligate receptor. Accidental similarities between human TfR1 and TfR1 orthologs of arenviral host species enable zoonoses, whereas mice and rats are not infectable because they lack these TfR1 determinants of infection. All pathogenic New World arenaviruses bind to a common region of the apical domain of TfR1. The ability of a New World arenavirus to use human TfR1 is absolutely predictive of its ability to cause hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Non-pathogenic arenaviruses, closely related to hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses, cannot utilize human TfR1 but efficiently enter cells through TfR1 orthologs of their native rodent hosts. Mutagenesis studies suggest that minor changes in the entry glycoproteins of these non-pathogenic viruses may allow human transmission.

The syndrome affects newborn calves and is characterized by pancytopenia, severe bleeding and high lethality. So far, a causative role of infectious or toxic agents has been ruled out. Instead, the syndrome is induced after ingestion of colostrum, the first milk that supplies the calf with maternal antibodies. In analogy to similar diseases in humans it has therefore been postulated that BNP is caused by alloreactive, maternal antibodies. There is a striking association between BNP and a previous vaccination of the respective dams with a particular vaccine against Bovine Virus Diarrhoea (BVD). This association has led to a suspension of the marketing authorisation for the vaccine, by the European Commission. The current study investigates the role of this vaccine in the pathogenesis of BNP. By flow cytometry we were able to demonstrate that sera of BNP dams (dams that gave birth to a BNP calf) harbour alloreactive antibodies binding to surface antigens on bovine leukocytes. A significantly weaker alloreactivity was observed with sera of non-BNP dams that have been vaccinated with the same vaccine but delivered healthy calves. No binding was seen with non-BVD-vaccinated control cows and animals that were vaccinated with other inactivated BVD vaccines so far not associated with BNP. The binding is functionally relevant, because opsonization of bovine leukocytes with alloantibodies led to an elevated cytophagocytosis by bovine macrophages. To test whether the vaccine induces alloreactive antibodies two strategies were employed: Guinea pigs were vaccinated with a panel of commercially available BVD-vaccines. Only the incriminated vaccine induced antibodies binding surface antigens on bovine leukocytes. Additionally, two calves were repeatedly vaccinated with the suspected vaccine and the development of alloreactivity was monitored. In dependence of the number of booster immunizations the induction of alloreactive antibodies could be observed. Finally, by affinity purification we were able to directly demonstrate that BNP associated alloantibodies cross react with the bovine kidney cell line used for vaccine production. Together this provides strong evidence that this particular BVD vaccine has the potential to induce BNP associated alloantibodies.",2011-07-18,"Bastian,Max;Holsteg,Mark;Hanke-Robinson,Heidrun;Duchow,Karin;Cussler,Klaus",Vaccine,24963801,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21605614/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11007213;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11007213;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.05.012,00t28df6,

The lymphoid chemokine, CXCL13, is critical for B cell recruitment and functional organization of peripheral lymphoid tissues, and CXCL13 levels are often elevated in the inflamed CNS. To more directly investigate the role of CXCL13 in CNS B cell migration, its role in animal models of infectious and inflammatory demyelinating disease was examined. During acute alphavirus encephalitis where viral clearance depends on the local actions of anti-viral antibodies, CXCL13 levels and B cell numbers increased in brain tissue over time. Surprisingly, however, CXCL13-deficient animals showed normal CNS B cell recruitment, unaltered CNS virus replication and clearance, and intact peripheral anti-viral antibody responses. During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), CNS levels of CXCL13 increased as symptoms emerged and equivalent numbers of B cells were identified among the CNS infiltrates of CXCL13-deficient mice compared to control animals. However, CXCL13-deficient mice did not sustain pathogenic anti-myelin T cell responses, consistent with their known propensity to develop more self-limited EAE. These data show that CXCL13 is dispensable for CNS B cell recruitment in both models. The disease course is unaffected by CXCL13 in a CNS infection paradigm that depends on a pathogen-specific B cell response, while it is heightened and prolonged by CXCL13 when myelin-specific CD4+ T cells drive CNS pathology.

The antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection has been recognised in experimentally infected cats, and cellular immunity is considered to play an important role in preventing the onset of FIP. To evaluate the importance of cellular immunity for FIPV infection, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against feline interferon (fIFN)-γ were first created to establish fIFN-γ detection systems using the MAbs. Six anti-fIFN-γ MAbs were created. Then, the difference in epitope which those MAbs recognise was demonstrated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IFN-γ neutralisation tests. Detection systems for fIFN-γ (sandwich ELISA, ELISpot assay, and two-colour flow cytometry) were established using anti-fIFN-γ MAbs that recognise different epitopes. In all tests, fIFN-γ production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from cats experimentally infected with an FIPV isolate that did not develop the disease was significantly increased by heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation in comparison with medium alone. Especially, CD8+fIFN-γ + cells, but not CD4+fIFN-γ + cells, were increased. In contrast, fIFN-γ production from PBMCs isolated from cats that had developed FIP and specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats was not increased by heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation.

Like the formation of P bodies, this phenomenon changes the spatial relationship between components involved in translation and mRNA degradation. We report significant spatial separation of Dhh1 and Pat1 from ribosomes in exponentially growing cells. Moreover, biochemical analyses reveal that these proteins are excluded from polysomal complexes in exponentially growing cells, indicating that they may not be associated with active states of the translation machinery. In contrast, under diauxic growth shift conditions, Dhh1 and Pat1 are found to co-localize with polysomal complexes. This work suggests that Dhh1 and Pat1 functions are modulated by a re-localization mechanism that involves eIF4A.

Recent research suggests that this seasonality in children is primarily related to viral respiratory tract infections. Regular hand washing is the most effective method to prevent the spread of viral respiratory infections; unfortunately, achieving hand washing recommendations in schools is difficult. Therefore, we designed a study to evaluate the effect of hand sanitizer use in elementary schools on exacerbations among children with asthma. Purpose To describe the process of redesigning the trial in response to changes in the safety profile of the hand sanitizer as well as changes in hand hygiene practice in the schools. Methods The original trial was a randomized, longitudinal, subject-blinded, placebo-controlled, community-based crossover trial. The primary aim was to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of hand sanitizer use in addition to usual hand hygiene practices to decrease asthma exacerbations in elementary-age children. Three events occurred that required major modifications to the original study protocol: (1) safety concerns arose regarding the hand sanitizer’s active ingredient; (2) no substitute placebo hand sanitizer was available; and (3) community preferences changed regarding hand hygiene practices in the schools. Results The revised protocol is a randomized, longitudinal, community-based crossover trial. The primary aim is to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of a two-step hand hygiene process (hand hygiene education plus institutionally provided alcohol-based hand sanitizer) versus usual care to decrease asthma exacerbations. Enrollment was completed in May 2009 with 527 students from 30 schools. The intervention began in August 2009 and will continue through May 2011. Study results should be available at the end of 2011. Limitations The changed design does not allow us to directly measure the effectiveness of hand sanitizer use as a supplement to traditional hand washing practices.

Non-gastrointestinal (GI) infections may increase the risk of developing IBS. There are also data showing that a GI infection may trigger functional dyspepsia (PI-FD). The possible development of PI-IBS or PI-FD depends on factors related to both the infection and the host. Microinflammation has been found in patients with post-infectious FGID. Studies performed in animal models show that infection and acute inflammation permanently change gastrointestinal motility and sensitivity. The role of AGE in the development of FGID is important not only because this entity provides an excellent natural model for pathogenic study but also because it provides an opportunity for preventive action.,2011-06-08,"Mearin,Fermín;Balboa,Agustín",GastroenterolHepatol,,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115640/,135y5oha,

Thermodynamic and phylogenetic analyses predicted that the REE folds as a long stable stem–loop (designated SL6), conserved among all tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV). Homologous sequences and potential base pairing were found in the corresponding regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, but not in more genetically distant flaviviruses. To investigate the role of SL6, nucleotide substitutions were introduced which changed a conserved hexanucleotide motif, the conformation of the terminal loop and the base-paired dsRNA stacking. Substitutions were made within a TBEV reverse genetic system and recovered mutants were compared for plaque morphology, single-step replication kinetics and cytopathic effect. The greatest phenotypic changes were observed in mutants with a destabilized stem. Point mutations in the conserved hexanucleotide motif of the terminal loop caused moderate virus attenuation. However, all mutants eventually reached the titre of wild-type virus late post-infection. Thus, although not essential for growth in tissue culture, the SL6 REE acts to up-regulate virus replication. We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.",2011-05-27,"Tuplin,A.;Evans,D.J.;Buckley,A.;Jones,I.M.;Gould,E.A.;Gritsun,T.S.",NucleicAcidsRes,,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3303483/,0aiaklrn,

The effectiveness of applying these techniques varies widely, and pollutant removal efficiency is usually determined in controlled laboratory environments which may not be realized in practice. Some air cleaners are largely ineffective, and some produce harmful by-products. To summarize what is known regarding the effectiveness of fan-driven air cleaning technologies, a state-of-the-art review of the scientific literature was undertaken by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from Europe, North America, and Asia with expertise in air cleaning, aerosol science, medicine, chemistry and ventilation. The effects on health were not examined. Over 26,000 articles were identified in major literature databases; 400 were selected as being relevant based on their titles and abstracts by the first two authors, who further reduced the number of articles to 160 based on the full texts. These articles were reviewed by the panel using predefined inclusion criteria during their first meeting. Additions were also made by the panel. Of these, 133 articles were finally selected for detailed review. Each article was assessed independently by two members of the panel and then judged by the entire panel during a consensus meeting. During this process 59 articles were deemed conclusive and their results were used for final reporting at their second meeting. The conclusions are that: (1) None of the reviewed technologies was able to effectively remove all indoor pollutants and many were found to generate undesirable by-products during operation. (2) Particle filtration and sorption of gaseous pollutants were among the most effective air cleaning technologies, but there is insufficient information regarding long-term performance and proper maintenance. (3) The existing data make it difficult to extract information such as Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR), which represents a common benchmark for comparing the performance of different air cleaning technologies. (4) To compare and select suitable indoor air cleaning devices, a labeling system accounting for characteristics such as CADR, energy consumption, volume, harmful by-products, and life span is necessary. For that purpose, a standard test room and condition should be built and studied.

Effective antiviral agents are lacking that specifically target RNA viruses such as measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses, and available vaccinations have demonstrated variable efficacy. Therefore, the development of novel antiviral agents is needed to close the vaccination gap and silence outbreaks. We previously indentified mucroporin, a cationic host defense peptide from scorpion venom, which can effectively inhibit standard bacteria. The optimized mucroporin-M1 can inhibit gram-positive bacteria at low concentrations and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In this investigation, we further tested mucroporin and the optimized mucroporin-M1 for their antiviral activity. Surprisingly, we found that the antiviral activities of mucroporin-M1 against measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses were notably increased with an EC(50) of 7.15 μg/ml (3.52 μM) and a CC(50) of 70.46 μg/ml (34.70 μM) against measles virus, an EC(50) of 14.46 μg/ml (7.12 μM) against SARS-CoV and an EC(50) of 2.10 μg/ml (1.03 μM) against H5N1, while the original peptide mucroporin showed no antiviral activity against any of these three viruses. The inhibition model could be via a direct interaction with the virus envelope, thereby decreasing the infectivity of virus.

In this work we provide estimates of the transmission potential of the virus and we assess the efficacy of the measures undertaken by public health authorities to control the epidemic spread.

The cumulative number of notified cases predicted by the model was 185 on average (95% CI 117–278), in good agreement with observed data. The probability of observing a major outbreak after the introduction of an infective human case was estimated to be in the range of 32%–76%. We found that the basic reproduction number was in the range of 1.8–6 but it could have been even larger, depending on the density of mosquitoes, which in turn depends on seasonal meteorological effects, besides other local abiotic factors.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The viruses were detected directly from blood plasma using pyrosequencing, without prior virus isolation and with minimal PCR amplification. The two new SHFV variants, SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 are highly divergent from each other (51.9% nucleotide sequence identity) and from the SHFV type strain LVR 42-0/M6941 (52.0% and 51.8% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively) and demonstrate greater phylogenetic diversity within SHFV than has been documented within any other arterivirus.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results represent the first documentation of SHFV in a wild primate and confirm the unusual 3′ genetic architecture of SHFV relative to the other arteriviruses.

METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scirus, and Scielo were searched (to December 2008) for reports of accidental viral infections, written in English, Portuguese, Spanish, or German; the authors’ personal file of scientific articles and references from the articles retrieved in the initial search were also used. Systematic review was carried out with inclusion criteria of presence of accidental viral infection's cases information, and exclusion criteria of absence of information about the viral etiology, and at least probable mode of infection. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-one scientific articles were obtained, 66 of which were included in the analysis. For arboviruses, 84% of the laboratory infections had aerosol as the source; for alphaviruses alone, aerosol exposure accounted for 94% of accidental infections. Of laboratory arboviral infections, 15.7% were acquired percutaneously, whereas 41.6% of hospital infections were percutaneous. For airborne viruses, 81% of the infections occurred in laboratories, with hantavirus the leading causative agent. Aerosol inhalation was implicated in 96% of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections, 99% of hantavirus infections, and 50% of coxsackievirus infections, but infective droplet inhalation was the leading mode of infection for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the mucocutaneous mode of infection was involved in the case of infection with influenza B. For blood-borne viruses, 92% of infections occurred in hospitals and 93% of these had percutaneous mode of infection, while among laboratory infections 77% were due to infective aerosol inhalation. Among blood-borne virus infections there were six cases of particular note: three cases of acute hepatitis following hepatitis C virus infection with a short period of incubation, one laboratory case of human immunodeficiency virus infection through aerosol inhalation, one case of hepatitis following hepatitis G virus infection, and one case of fulminant hepatitis with hepatitis B virus infection following exposure of the worker's conjunctiva to hepatitis B virus e antigen-negative patient saliva. Of the 12 infections with viruses with preferential mucocutaneous transmission, seven occurred percutaneously, aerosol was implicated as a possible source of infection in two cases, and one atypical infection with Macacine herpesvirus 1 with fatal encephalitis as the outcome occurred through a louse bite. One outbreak of norovirus infection among hospital staff had as its probable mode of infection the ingestion of inocula spread in the environment by fomites. CONCLUSIONS: The currently accepted and practiced risk analysis of accidental viral infections based on the conventional dynamics of infection of the etiological agents is insufficient to cope with accidental viral infections in laboratories and to a lesser extent in hospitals, where unconventional modes of infection are less frequently present but still have relevant clinical and potential epidemiological consequences. Unconventional modes of infection, atypical clinical development, or extremely severe cases are frequently present together with high viral loads and high virulence of the agents manipulated in laboratories. In hospitals by contrast, the only possible association of atypical cases is with the individual resistance of the worker. Current standard precaution practices are insufficient to prevent most of the unconventional infections in hospitals analyzed in this study; it is recommended that special attention be given to flaviviruses in these settings.",2011-04-14,"Pedrosa,PedroB.S.;Cardoso,TelmaA.O.",IntJInfectDis,12344733,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971211000555;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2011.03.005;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971211000555;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21497126/,06giqn03,

More milk can be fed, by feeding 3 times a day or using acidified or cold milk procedures. A high-quality starter feed should be fed beginning the second week of life. A kid must be a minimum of 6 weeks of age to be weaned, weigh at least 10 kg, and have a starter intake of at least 250 g day(-1). Kids can be transitioned to weaning by reducing milk feeding to one time a day. After weaning, the kid should be fed 360 g of starter feed per day and all of the high-quality hay they can eat. The kid should gain 150 g day(-1) from birth and weigh 35 kg by 7 months of age when they can be bred. Kid health problems can be prevented by consumption of adequate colostrum, well-ventilated environment, avoiding crowding, and good sanitation.

Whereas dynamin-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is generally considered as the IAV infection pathway, some observations suggest the occurrence of an as yet uncharacterized alternative entry route. By manipulating entry parameters we established experimental conditions that allow the separate analysis of dynamin-dependent and -independent entry of IAV. Whereas entry of IAV in phosphate-buffered saline could be completely inhibited by dynasore, a specific inhibitor of dynamin, a dynasore-insensitive entry pathway became functional in the presence of fetal calf serum. This finding was confirmed with the use of small interfering RNAs targeting dynamin-2. In the presence of serum, both IAV entry pathways were operational. Under these conditions entry could be fully blocked by combined treatment with dynasore and the amiloride derivative EIPA, the hallmark inhibitor of macropinocytosis, whereas either drug alone had no effect. The sensitivity of the dynamin-independent entry pathway to inhibitors or dominant-negative mutants affecting actomyosin dynamics as well as to a number of specific inhibitors of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream effectors thereof all point to the involvement of macropinocytosis in IAV entry. Consistently, IAV particles and soluble FITC-dextran were shown to co-localize in cells in the same vesicles.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 4 cases of metapneumovirus pneumonia (mean age of 52.3 years) in an institutional outbreak (Castle Peak Hospital) in 2008 and 38 cases of SARS-coronovirus (mean age of 39.6 years) admitted to Tuen Mun hospital during an epidemic outbreak in 2003 were included. HRCT findings of the lungs for all patients were retrospectively reviewed by two independent radiologists. RESULTS: In the metapneumovirus group, common HRCT features were ground glass opacities (100%), consolidation (100%), parenchymal band (100%), bronchiectasis (75%). Crazy paving pattern was absent. They were predominantly subpleural and basal in location and bilateral involvement was observed in 50% of patients. In the SARS group, common HRCT features were ground glass opacities (92.1%), interlobular septal thickening (86.8%), crazy paving pattern (73.7%) and consolidation (68%). Bronchiectasis was not seen. Majority of patient demonstrated segmental or lobar in distribution and bilateral involvement was observed in 44.7% of patients. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were of consistent rare features in both groups.

Here, we describe a proposed intervention that would overcome these challenges by capitalizing upon Therapeutic Interfering Particles (TIPs) that are engineered to replicate conditionally in the presence of the pathogen and spread between individuals — analogous to ‘transmissible immunization’ that occurs with live-attenuated vaccines (but without the potential for reversion to virulence). Building on analyses of HIV field data from sub-Saharan Africa, we construct a multi-scale model, beginning at the single-cell level, to predict the effect of TIPs on individual patient viral loads and ultimately population-level disease prevalence. Our results show that a TIP, engineered with properties based on a recent HIV gene-therapy trial, could stably lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by ∼30-fold within 50 years and could complement current therapies. In contrast, optimistic antiretroviral therapy or vaccination campaigns alone could only lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by <2-fold over 50 years. The TIP's efficacy arises from its exploitation of the same risk factors as the pathogen, allowing it to autonomously penetrate superspreader populations, maintain efficacy despite behavioral disinhibition, and limit viral resistance. While demonstrated here for HIV, the TIP concept could apply broadly to many viral infectious diseases and would represent a new paradigm for disease control, away from pathogen eradication but toward robust disease suppression.",2011-03-17,"Metzger,VincentT.;Lloyd-Smith,JamesO.;Weinberger,LeorS.",PLoSComputBiol,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060167/,0gt21051,

HCMV is also an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- infected patients with AIDS, and solid organ and allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients. Current treatments for HCMV-associated diseases are insufficient due to the emergence of drug-induced resistance and cytotoxicity, necessitating novel approaches to limit HCMV infection. The aim of this study was to develop therapeutic peptides targeting glycoprotein B (gB), a major glycoprotein of HCMV that is highly conserved across the Herpesviridae family, that specifically inhibit fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane preventing HCMV entry and infection. RESULTS: Using the Wimley-White Interfacial Hydrophobicity Scale (WWIHS), several regions within gB were identified that display a high potential to interact with lipid bilayers of cell membranes and hydrophobic surfaces within proteins. The ability of synthetic peptides analogous to WWIHS-positive sequences of HCMV gB to inhibit viral infectivity was evaluated.

KAA-2 bound exclusively to high mannose type N-glycans, but not to other glycans such as complex type, hybrid type, or the pentasaccharide core of N-glycans. This lectin exhibited a preference for an exposed α1–3 Man on a D2 arm in a similar manner to Eucheuma serra agglutinin (ESA-2), which shows various biological activities, such as anti-HIV and anti-carcinogenic activity. We tested the anti-influenza virus activity of KAA-2 against various strains including the recent pandemic H1N1-2009 influenza virus. KAA-2 inhibited infection of various influenza strains with EC50s of low nanomolar levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-influenza antibody demonstrated that the antiviral activity of KAA-2 was exerted by interference with virus entry into host cells. This mechanism was further confirmed by the evidence of direct binding of KAA-2 to a viral envelope protein, hemagglutinin (HA), using an ELISA assay.

Few epidemiological studies have been published based solely on DFA and none included respiratory picornaviruses and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We wished to evaluate the use of DFA for epidemiological studies with a long-term observation of respiratory viruses that includes both respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV. METHODS: Since 1998 all children hospitalized with respiratory illness at the University Hospital Bern have been screened with DFA for common respiratory viruses including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, and parainfluenza virus 1-3. In 2006 assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV were added. Here we describe the epidemiological pattern for these respiratory viruses detected by DFA in 10'629 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from 8'285 patients during a 12-year period (1998-2010). RESULTS: Addition of assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV raised the proportion of positive DFA results from 35% to 58% (p < 0.0001). Respiratory picornaviruses were the most common viruses detected among patients ≥1 year old. The seasonal patterns and age distribution for the studied viruses agreed well with those reported in the literature. In 2010, an hMPV epidemic of unexpected size was observed. CONCLUSIONS: DFA is a valid, rapid, flexible and inexpensive method. The addition of assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV broadens its range of viral detection.

We generated recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) LC16m8 strain which simultaneously expresses four structural proteins of SARS-CoV, including nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelop (E), spike (S) proteins (rVV-NMES) and reported that old BALB/c mice having prior immunization with rVV-NMES develop severe pneumonia similar to those of control mice though rVV-NMES-immunized mice showed lower pulmonary viral titer than in the control mice. Furthermore, we determined which SARS-CoV structural protein for the prior rVV-immunization is responsible for the severe pneumonia after the SARS-CoV infection as observed in the rVV-NMES-immunized mice. Old BALB/c mice were inoculated intradermally with rVV that expressed each structural proteins of SARS-CoV (rVV-N, -M, -E, or -S) with or without rVV-S and then infected intranasally with SARS-CoV more than 4 weeks later. At 9 days after SARS-CoV infection, the rVV-N-immunized mice show more severe pneumonia than in other groups. Furthermore, significant up-regulation of Th1 (IL-2)- and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5)-bias cytokines and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-β) were observed in rVV-N-immunized mice, resulting in the intensive infiltration of immunocompetent cells into the lung. In contrast, rVV-S-immunized mice showed only low pulmonary viral tier and slight pneumonia. However, the mice having co-immunization with both rVV-N and rVV-S showed severe pneumonia though their pulmonary viral titer was low. These results suggest that an excessive host immune response against the N protein of SARS-CoV is involved in severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV infection.

Estas exacerbaciones se deben a infecciones bacterianas y virales, y a factores estresantes medioambientales, pero otras enfermedades concomitantes como las cardiopatías, otras enfermedades pulmonares (como la embolia pulmonar, la aspiración o el neumotórax) y otros procesos sistémicos, pueden desencadenar o complicar estas agudizaciones. En la fisiopatología de las exacerbaciones los dos factores que más influyen son la hiperinsuflación dinámica y la inflamación local y sistémica. El tratamiento farmacológico en la mayoría de los pacientes incluye broncodilatadores de acción corta, corticoides sistémicos y antibióticos. La insuficiencia respiratoria hipoxémica requiere oxigenoterapia controlada y en la insuficiencia respiratoria hipercápnica la ventilación con presión positiva no invasiva puede permitir ganar tiempo hasta que otros tratamientos empiecen a funcionar y, así, evitar la intubación endotraqueal. El uso de ventilación mecánica no invasiva nunca debe retrasar la intubación si ésta está indicada. Los criterios de alta hospitalaria se basan en la estabilización, tanto clínica como gasométrica, y en la capacidad del paciente para poder controlar la enfermedad en su domicilio. La hospitalización domiciliaria puede ser una opción de tratamiento de la exacerbación de la EPOC con eficacia equivalente a la hospitalización convencional. Abstract Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are considered to be episodes of instability that favor disease progression, reduce quality of life, increase the risk of death and cause substantial healthcare resource use. These exacerbations are due to bacterial and viral infections and environmental stressors. However, other concomitant diseases such as heart disease, other lung diseases (e.g. pulmonary embolism, aspiration or pneumothorax) and other systemic processes can trigger or complicate these exacerbations. The two factors with the greatest influence on the physiopathology of exacerbations are dynamic overinflation and local and systemic inflammation. In most patients, drug treatment includes short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics. Hypoxemic respiratory failure requires controlled oxygen therapy. In hypercapnic respiratory failure, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may allow time to be gained until other treatments begin to take effect and can thus avoid endotracheal intubation. The use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation should never delay intubation, if indicated. Hospital discharge criteria are based on both clinical and gasometric stabilization and on the patient's ability to manage his or her disease at home. Hospitalization at home can be a treatment option in COPD exacerbations and is as effective as conventional hospitalization.",2010-12-31,"CalleRubio,Myriam;Chacón,BeatrizMorales;RodríguezHermosa,JuanLuis",ArchivosdeBronconeumología,71634699,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289610700429;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289610700429,0pdzfq94,

These projects have played an important role by complementing national efforts in the fight against HIV/AIDS in China. Methods The diverse characteristics of these projects followed three phases over 20 years. Initially, stand-alone projects provided technical support in surveillance, training or advocacy for public awareness. As the epidemic spread across China, projects became a part of the comprehensive and integrated national response. Currently, international best practices encourage the inclusion of civil society and non-governmental organizations in an expanded response to the epidemic. Results Funding from international projects has accounted for one-third of the resources provided for the HIV/AIDS response in China. Beyond this strong financial support, these programmes have introduced best practices, accelerated the introduction of AIDS policies, strengthened capacity, improved the development of grassroots social organizations and established a platform for communication and experience sharing with the international community. However, there are still challenges ahead, including integrating existing resources and exploring new programme models. The National Centre for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention (NCAIDS) in China is consolidating all international projects into national HIV prevention, treatment and care activities.

Studies in humans and animal models have shown that symptoms are not immediate and appear days or even weeks after infection. Since the initial symptoms are a manifestation of virus recognition by elements of the innate immune response, early virus replication must go largely undetected. The interval between infection and the emergence of symptoms is called the incubation period and is widely used as a clinical score. While incubation periods have been described for many virus infections the underlying mechanism for this asymptomatic phase has not been comprehensively documented. Here we review studies of the interaction between human pathogenic respiratory RNA viruses and the host with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms used by viruses to inhibit immunity. We discuss the concept of the “stealth phase”, defined as the time between infection and the earliest detectable inflammatory response. We propose that the “stealth phase” phenomenon is primarily responsible for the suppression of symptoms during the incubation period and results from viral antagonism that inhibits major pathways of the innate immune system allowing an extended time of unhindered virus replication.",2010-11-18,"Hermesh,Tamar;Moltedo,Bruno;López,CarolinaB.;Moran,ThomasM.",Viruses,2407352,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994630/;https://doi.org/10.3390/v2112541,0yqv2osb,

The objective of this study was to compare the short-term virological efficacy of oseltamivir-zanamivir combination versus each monotherapy plus placebo. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial with 145 general practitioners throughout France during the 2008–2009 seasonal influenza epidemic. Patients, general practitioners, and outcome assessors were all blinded to treatment assignment. Adult outpatients presenting influenza-like illness for less than 36 hours and a positive influenza A rapid test diagnosis were randomized to oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily plus zanamivir 10 mg by inhalation twice daily (OZ), oseltamivir plus inhaled placebo (O), or zanamivir plus oral placebo (Z). Treatment efficacy was assessed virologically according to the proportion of patients with nasal influenza reverse transcription (RT)-PCR below 200 copies genome equivalent (cgeq)/µl at day 2 (primary outcome), and clinically to the time to alleviation of symptoms until day 14. Overall 541 patients (of the 900 planned) were included (OZ, n = 192; O, n = 176; Z, n = 173), 49% male, mean age 39 years. In the intention-to-treat analysis conducted in the 447 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A, 46%, 59%, and 34% in OZ (n = 157), O (n = 141), and Z (n = 149) arms had RT-PCR<200 cgeq/µl (−13.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] −23.1 to −2.9, p = 0.025; +12.3%, 95% CI 2.39–22.2, p = 0.028 for OZ/O and OZ/Z comparisons). Mean day 0 to day 2 viral load decrease was 2.14, 2.49, and 1.68 log(10) cgeq/µl (p = 0.060, p = 0.016 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Median time to alleviation of symptoms was 4.0, 3.0, and 4.0 days (+1.0, 95% CI 0.0–4.0, p = 0.018; +0.0, 95% CI −3.0 to 3.0, p = 0.960 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Four severe adverse events were observed. Nausea and/or vomiting tended to be more frequent in the combination arm (OZ, n = 13; O, n = 4; and Z, n = 5 patients, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In adults with seasonal influenza A mainly H3N2 virus infection, the oseltamivir-zanamivir combination appeared less effective than oseltamivir monotherapy, and not significantly more effective than zanamivir monotherapy. Despite the theoretical potential for the reduction of the emergence of antiviral resistance, the lower effectiveness of this combination calls for caution in its use in clinical practice.

In order to elucidate the multifactorial aetiology of porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) in Denmark, lungs from 148 finishing pigs with cranioventral bronchopneumonia (case group) and 60 pigs without lung lesions (control group) were collected from abattoirs. The pathogens involved in PRDC and their interactions were identified and linked to the histopathological diagnosis. The lung samples were cultured for bacteria and tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for presence of swine influenza virus (type A), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (both European and US type), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine respiratory coronavirus, porcine cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Mycoplasma hyorhinis. All cases had cranioventral lobular bronchopneumonia consistent with PRDC. There was a broad range of microscopical lesions and the cases were characterized as acute (n =10), subacute (n =24) or chronic (n =114) bronchopneumonia. Five bacterial species, five viruses and two Mycoplasma spp. were detected in different combinations. PCV2, M. hyopneumoniae, M. hyorhinis and Pasteurella multocida were detected most frequently among the PRDC affected swine and the diversity and number of pathogens were higher in these animals compared with controls. No clear-cut associations were detected between pathogens and histological lesions or histopathological diagnoses.

The expressed heavy and light chain variable genes (VH and VL) were isolated from spleen B cells and amplified to construct phage antibody libraries containing scFv molecules. After four rounds of panning selection, the scFv antibodies of randomly chosen clones were expressed and their binding specificity to α-enolase protein was verified using competitive ELISA, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Nucleotide sequence analysis from 10 α-enolase binding clones showed that 3 (30%) clones used identical heavy and light genes for scFv antibody expression, as represented by EnL5. Notably, amino acid changes in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were more frequently observed than those in framework regions (FRs) in all clones, indicating a strong affinity selection through mutations.

Th1 and Th2 cytokines in induced sputum samples during the course of acute upper respiratory viral infections in otherwise healthy and asthmatic individuals were monitored. IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-γ were assayed by ELISA. Viral infection symptoms and asthma severity scores were monitored. Time trends were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: IL-4 and IL-5 levels in groups C and D were higher than in groups A and B. IFN-γ levels and viral infection symptoms scores in group B spiked by day 2 and rapidly declined by day 7, while in group D, IFN-γ and symptoms scores for viral infection and asthma peaked much later (days 3-5) and slowly declined.

Forty-five late-gestation Holstein-Friesian cows (second pregnancy) were allocated randomly to 1 of 3 groups with 15 cows/group: group C6 (6 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10mg/kg of body weight (BW) and cyanocobalamin at 5μg/kg of BW in the last 2 wk of gestation); group C3 (3 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10mg/kg of BW and cyanocobalamin at 5μg/kg of BW in the last week of gestation); and group C0 (equivolume daily i.v. injections of 0.9% NaCl solution). Serum biochemical analysis was performed on jugular venous blood samples that were periodically obtained a.p. and postpartum (p.p.). Health status and milk production were monitored p.p. Serum cyanocobalamin concentration increased in groups C6 and C3 p.p. Multiple daily i.v. injections of Catosal before parturition increased p.p. glucose availability, as evaluated by p.p. serum glucose concentration, and decreased peripheral fat mobilization and ketone body formation, as evaluated by p.p. serum nonesterified fatty acid and β-OH butyrate concentrations. The number of puerperal infections in the first 5 d after calving was decreased in group C6, relative to group C0.

It is possible to completely sequence a small genome within days and this increases the number of publicly available genomes. Among the types of genomes being rapidly sequenced are those of microbial and viral genomes responsible for infectious diseases. However, accurate gene prediction is a challenge that persists for decoding a newly sequenced genome. Therefore, accurate and efficient gene prediction programs are highly desired for rapid and cost effective surveillance of RNA viruses through full genome sequencing. RESULTS: We have developed VIGOR (Viral Genome ORF Reader), a web application tool for gene prediction in influenza virus, rotavirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus subtypes. VIGOR detects protein coding regions based on sequence similarity searches and can accurately detect genome specific features such as frame shifts, overlapping genes, embedded genes, and can predict mature peptides within the context of a single polypeptide open reading frame. Genotyping capability for influenza and rotavirus is built into the program. We compared VIGOR to previously described gene prediction programs, ZCURVE_V, GeneMarkS and FLAN. The specificity and sensitivity of VIGOR are greater than 99% for the RNA viral genomes tested. CONCLUSIONS: VIGOR is a user friendly web-based genome annotation program for five different viral agents, influenza, rotavirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and SARS coronavirus. This is the first gene prediction program for rotavirus and rhinovirus for public access. VIGOR is able to accurately predict protein coding genes for the above five viral types and has the capability to assign function to the predicted open reading frames and genotype influenza virus.

In addition, involvement of XBP-1 in host cell–virus interaction and transcriptional regulation of viruses, such as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), has been revealed recently. Two XBP-1 isoforms, XBP-1U and XBP-1S, which share an identical N-terminal domain, are present in cells. XBP-1S is a transcription activator while XBP-1U is the inactive isoform. Although the transactivation domain of XBP-1S has been identified within the XBP-1S-specific C-terminus, molecular mechanism of the transcriptional activation by XBP-1S still remains unknown. Here we report the interaction between p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and XBP-1S through the C-terminal domain of XBP-1S. No binding between XBP-1U and PCAF is detected. In a cell-based reporter assay, overexpression of PCAF further stimulates the XBP-1S-mediated cellular and HTLV-1 transcription while knockdown of PCAF exhibits the opposite effect. Expression of endogenous XBP-1S cellular target genes, such as BiP and CHOP, is significantly inhibited when PCAF is knocked down. Furthermore, PCAF is recruited to the promoters of XBP-1S target genes in vivo, in a XBP-1S-dependent manner. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PCAF mediates the XBP-1S-dependent transcription through the interaction with XBP-1S.",2010-09-04,"Lew,QiaoJing;Chu,KaiLing;Lee,Jialing;Koh,PohLing;Rajasegaran,Vikneswari;Teo,JinYuan;Chao,Sheng-Hao",NucleicAcidsRes,8192393,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq785;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20817929/,174q2pjw,

In this study, unwinding of DNA substrates that had different duplex lengths and 5′-overhangs was examined under single-turnover reaction conditions in the presence of excess enzyme. The amount of DNA unwound decreased significantly as the length of the duplex increased, indicating a poor in vitro processivity. However, the quantity of duplex DNA unwound increased as the length of the single-stranded 5′-tail increased for the 50-bp duplex. This enhanced processivity was also observed for duplex DNA that had a longer single-stranded gap in between. These results demonstrate that nsP13 requires the presence of a long 5′-overhang to unwind longer DNA duplexes. In addition, enhanced DNA unwinding was observed for gapped DNA substrates that had a 5′-overhang, indicating that the translocated nsP13 molecules pile up and the preceding helicase facilitate DNA unwinding. Together with the propensity of oligomer formation of nsP13 molecules, we propose that the cooperative translocation by the functionally interacting oligomers of the helicase molecules loaded onto the 5′-overhang account for the observed enhanced processivity of DNA unwinding.",2010-07-29,"Lee,Na-Ra;Kwon,Hyun-Mi;Park,Kkothanahreum;Oh,Sangtaek;Jeong,Yong-Joo;Kim,Dong-Eun",NucleicAcidsRes,17027097,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq647;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20671029/,1k99yv4i,

OBJECTIVES: (1) Determine the overall incidence of RTIs in a daycare cohort using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). (2) Determine the relative incidence and impact of specific respiratory viruses, and characterize and compare clinical features associated with these pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective cohort study conducted from February 2006 to April 2008, nasal swabs were obtained from symptomatic children ages 0–30 months enrolled in fulltime daycare. RT-PCR was performed to detect respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), influenza (Flu) viruses A and B, parainfluenza (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), human coronaviruses (CoV) and rhinovirus (RhV). Symptom diaries were completed for each illness. RESULTS: We followed 119 children (mean age 10 months; range 2–24 months) for 115 child years. The mean annual incidence of RTI per child was 4.2 the first year and 1.2 the second year of the study. At least 1 virus was identified in 67% RTIs. Co-infections were common (27% RTIs), with RhV, CoV, and AdV the most common co-pathogens. PIV was identified in 12% of RTIs with a high incidence of PIV4. The viruses with the greatest impact on our population were RSV, RhV and AdV.

Here we consider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and G-U-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA structures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of interest to find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms, RNAinverse, RNA-SSD as well as INFO-RNA are limited to RNA secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm Inv which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures. RESULTS: In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm Inv. We give a detailed analysis of Inv, including pseudocodes. We show that Inv allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot 3-noncrossing RNA structures-a class which is difficult to construct via dynamic programming routines. Inv is freely available at http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm Inv extends inverse folding capabilities to RNA pseudoknot structures. In comparison with RNAinverse it uses new ideas, for instance by considering sets of competing structures.

While ELISAs are often used to measure antibody responses to one or several targets, new antibody-profiling technologies, such as protein microarrays, can now evaluate antibody responses to hundreds, or even thousands, of recombinant antigens at one time. These large-scale studies have uncovered new antigenic targets, provided new insights into vaccine research and yielded an overview of immunoreactivity against almost the entire proteome of certain pathogens. However, solid-phase antigen arrays also have drawbacks that limit the type of information obtained, including suboptimal detection of conformational epitopes, high backgrounds due to impure antigens and a narrow dynamic range of detection. We have developed a solution-phase antibody-profiling technology, luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), which harnesses light-emitting recombinant antigen fusion proteins to quantitatively measure patient antibody titers. Owing to the highly linear light output of the luciferase reporter, some antibodies can be detected without serum dilution in a dynamic range of detection often spanning seven orders of magnitude. When LIPS is applied iteratively with multiple target antigens, a high-definition antibody profile is obtained. Here, we discuss the application of these different antibody-profiling technologies and their associated limitations with particular emphasis on protein microarrays.

CD209 facilitates severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–coronavirus spike protein-bearing pseudotype driven infection of permissive cells in vitro. In keeping with previously published findings, our in vitro studies confirmed that this SNP modulates gene promoter activity. Genetic association analysis of this SNP with clinico-pathologic outcomes in 824 serologic confirmed SARS patients showed that the −336AG/GG genotype SARS patients was associated with lower standardized lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) levels compared with the −336AA patients (p = 0.014, odds ratio = 0.40). High LDH levels are known to be an independent predictor for poor clinical outcome, probably related to tissue destruction from immune hyperactivity. Hence, SARS patients with the CD209 −336 AA genotype carry a 60% chance of having a poorer prognosis.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is one of the most powerful tools for this purpose. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the method will depend on the careful selection of genes whose expression are stable and can be used as internal controls for a particular experimental setting. FINDINGS: The expression stability of five commonly used housekeeping genes [beta-actin (ACTB), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1A), ubiquitin (UBQ), glyceraldehyd-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and tubulin alpha (TUBA)] were monitored in salmonid cell lines CHSE-214 and RTS11 after infection with two of the most fastidious fish pathogens, the facultative bacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis and the aquabirnavirus IPNV (Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus). After geNorm analysis, UBQ and EF1A appeared as the most stable, although EF1A was slightly upregulated at late stages of P. salmonis infection in RTS11. ACTB instead, showed a good performance in each case, being always considered within the three most stable genes of the panel. In contrast, infection-dependent differential regulation of GAPDH and TUBA was also demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Based on the data presented here with the cell culture models CHSE-214 and RTS11, we suggest the initial choice of UBQ, ACTB and EF1A as reference genes in qRT-PCR assays for studying the effect of P. salmonis and IPNV on the host immune response.",2010-04-14,"Peña,AndreaA;Bols,NielsC;Marshall,SergioH",BMCResNotes,9473671,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-3-101;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20398263/,0xn6mqh6,

In contrast to most models of viral pathogenesis, infection of type I, type II or type III interferon knockout mice (129 background) with either Urbani or MA15 viruses resulted in clinical disease outcomes, including transient weight loss, denuding bronchiolitis and alveolar inflammation and recovery, identical to that seen in infection of wildtype mice. This suggests that type I, II and III interferon signaling play minor roles in regulating SARS pathogenesis in mouse models. In contrast, infection of STAT1−/− mice resulted in severe disease, high virus titer, extensive pulmonary lesions and 100% mortality by day 9 and 30 post-infection with rMA15 or Urbani viruses, respectively. Non-lethal in BALB/c mice, Urbani SARS-CoV infection in STAT1−/− mice caused disseminated infection involving the liver, spleen and other tissues after day 9.

In the present study, specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were immunized intramuscularly with a DNA vaccine carrying the main IBV structural genes (pVAX1-S1, pVAX1-M, and pVAX1-N, respectively) and boosted with the IBV M41 strain inactivated vaccine to assess whether such a new strategy could enhance the immune responses against IBV. The protection efficacy of the DNA vaccine carrying different structural genes for priming was evaluated further. The chickens were immunized primely on day 7 and boosted 2 weeks later. After that, distribution of the DNA vaccine in vivo, the percentage of CD4+CD3+ and CD8+CD3+ subgroups of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes, and the specific IgG and virus neutralizing antibodies were measured. Chickens were then challenged by the nasal–ocular route with the IBV M41 strain 4 weeks after booster immunization. The results demonstrated that priming with a DNA vaccine encoding nucleocapsid protein (pVAX1-N) and boosting with the inactivated IBV vaccine led to the dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses, and provided up to 86.7% rate of immune protection, providing an effective approach to protect chickens from IBV.",2010-03-20,"Guo,Zicheng;Wang,Hongning;Yang,Tai;Wang,Xue;Lu,Dan;Li,Yulin;Zhang,Yi",JVirolMethods,24514672,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20307574/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093410000960;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093410000960;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.03.016,1d17iafs,

We found that a PPxY motif within protein VI recruits Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases to bind and ubiquitylate protein VI. We further show that this PPxY motif is involved in rapid, microtubule-dependent intracellular movement of protein VI. Ads with a mutated PPxY motif can efficiently escape endosomes but are defective in microtubule-dependent trafficking toward the nucleus. Likewise, depletion of Nedd4 ligases attenuates nuclear accumulation of incoming Ad particles and infection.

An urgent worldwide threat is posed by the introduction and spread of novel infectious diseases. The reasons for emerging infectious diseases are numerous and complex. Among the most significant explanations for these emerging diseases are changes in environment and ecology caused by natural phenomena such as droughts, hurricanes, and floods; and human-made phenomena such as agricultural development, urbanization, and denuding of forests. Worldwide conflict, including wars, ethnic cleansing, and genocide, have led to displacement of large populations into overcrowded settlements where safe water is not available and sanitation is poor. For example, unsanitary conditions led to a huge increase in the rat population in post-war Kosovo, resulting in a tularemia outbreak with 327 confirmed cases in 8 months. Regional conflict leads to breakdown in infection control, inadequate surveillance, impeded access to populations, and spread of infectious diseases through movement of refugees and aid workers. Increased precipitation, a result of climate change, leads to more agricultural run-off, allowing pathogens to enter drinking water systems. In developing countries where poverty and inadequate infrastructure are the norm, public health monitoring systems must be supported and improved so that new or more severe risks to health can be identified and curtailed.

These interventions dampen virus spread by reducing contact between infected and susceptible persons. Because they curtail essential societal activities, they must be applied judiciously. Optimal control theory is an approach for modeling and balancing competing objectives such as epidemic spread and NPI cost. METHODS: We apply optimal control on an epidemiologic compartmental model to develop triggers for NPI implementation. The objective is to minimize expected person-days lost from influenza related deaths and NPI implementations for the model. We perform a multivariate sensitivity analysis based on Latin Hypercube Sampling to study the effects of input parameters on the optimal control policy. Additional studies investigated the effects of departures from the modeling assumptions, including exponential terminal time and linear NPI implementation cost. RESULTS: An optimal policy is derived for the control model using a linear NPI implementation cost. Linear cost leads to a ""bang-bang"" policy in which NPIs are applied at maximum strength when certain state criteria are met. Multivariate sensitivity analyses are presented which indicate that NPI cost, death rate, and recovery rate are influential in determining the policy structure. Further death rate, basic reproductive number and recovery rate are the most influential in determining the expected cumulative death. When applying the NPI policy, the cumulative deaths under exponential and gamma terminal times are close, which implies that the outcome of applying the ""bang-bang"" policy is insensitive to the exponential assumption. Quadratic cost leads to a multi-level policy in which NPIs are applied at varying strength levels, again based on certain state criteria. Results indicate that linear cost leads to more costly implementation resulting in fewer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The application of optimal control theory can provide valuable insight to developing effective control strategies for pandemic.

Herein, we show that IPS-1, the central adaptor protein to RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling, is essential for triggering of innate immunity and for effective development and regulation of adaptive immunity against pathogenic WNV. IPS-1(−/−) mice exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV infection marked by enhanced viral replication and dissemination with early viral entry into the CNS. Infection of cultured bone-marrow (BM) derived dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages (Macs), and primary cortical neurons showed that the IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling was essential for triggering IFN defenses and controlling virus replication in these key target cells of infection. Intriguingly, infected IPS-1(−/−) mice displayed uncontrolled inflammation that included elevated systemic type I IFN, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses, increased numbers of inflammatory DCs, enhanced humoral responses marked by complete loss of virus neutralization activity, and increased numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and non-specific immune cell proliferation in the periphery and in the CNS. This uncontrolled inflammatory response was associated with a lack of regulatory T cell expansion that normally occurs during acute WNV infection. Thus, the enhanced inflammatory response in the absence of IPS-1 was coupled with a failure to protect against WNV infection.

In the present study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequences of the spike (S) glycoprotein genes of seven Korean PEDV isolates. The entire S genes of all isolates were found to be nine nucleotides longer in length than other PEDV reference strains. This size difference was due to the combined presence of notable 15 bp insertion and 6 bp deletion within the N-terminal region of the S1 domain of the Korean isolates. In addition, the largest number of amino acid variations was accumulated in the S1 N-terminal region, leading to the presence of hypervariability in the isolates. Sequence comparisons at the peptide level of the S proteins revealed that all seven Korean isolates shared diverse similarities ranging from a 93.6% to 99.6% identity with each other but exhibited a 92.2% to 93.7% identity with other reference strains. Collectively, the sequence analysis data indicate the diversity of the PEDV isolates currently prevalent in Korea that represents a heterogeneous group. Phylogenetic analyses showed two separate clusters, in which all Korean field isolates were grouped together in the second cluster (group 2). The results indicate that prevailing isolates in Korea are phylogenetically more closely related to each other rather than other reference strains.

We have evaluated a multiplex real-time PCR method for the detection of 13 respiratory viruses and 2 bacteria (Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila) in a clinical setting. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical use of a novel multiplex PCR method in adults with community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the impact of duration of symptoms on detection rates. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal swab samples were prospectively collected from 209 adult outpatients with respiratory infections and 100 asymptomatic controls. RESULTS: An infectious agent was identified in 43% of samples from patients and 2% of asymptomatic controls. The detection rate was significantly higher in samples from patients with a duration of symptoms of 6 days or less (51%) than in samples from patients with a duration of symptoms of 7 days or more (30%, p < 0.01). For human corona viruses, and influenza virus A and B there was a correlation between the amount of virus in each patient sample as measured Ct values and duration of symptoms.

This pediatric disease follows rapid course leading to 55–75% mortality. In the absence of specific treatment, effectiveness of RNA interference (RNAi) was evaluated. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Efficacy of synthetic short interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in protecting mice from CHPV infection was assessed. The target genes were P and M genes primarily because important role of the former in viral replication and lethal nature of the latter. Real time one step RT-PCR and plaque assay were used for the assessment of gene silencing. Using pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P, we showed that P-2 siRNA was most efficient in reducing the expression of P gene in-vitro. Both quantitative assays documented 2logs reduction in the virus titer when P-2, M-5 or M-6 siRNAs were transfected 2hr post infection (PI). Use of these siRNAs in combination did not result in enhanced efficiency. P-2 siRNA was found to tolerate four mismatches in the center. As compared to five different shRNAs, P-2 siRNA was most effective in inhibiting CHPV replication. An extended survival was noted when mice infected intracranially with 100 LD(50) CHPV were treated with cationic lipid complexed 5 µg P-2 siRNA simultaneously. Infection with 10LD(50) and treatment with two doses of siRNA first, simultaneously and second 24 hr PI, resulted in 70% survival. Surviving mice showed 4logs less CHPV titers in brain without histopathological changes or antibody response. Gene expression profiles of P-2 siRNA treated mice showed no interferon response. First dose of siRNA at 2hr or 4hr PI with second dose at 24hr resulted in 40% and 20% survival respectively suggesting potential application in therapy.

One of these classes, enterotoxigenic E coli, is the most common cause of diarrhea in beef and dairy calves in the first 4 days of life. Two other diarrheagenic classes, enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC), are important causes of disease in human beings, but less well substantiated causes of diarrhea in calves. E coli strains that cause hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans, express high levels of Shiga toxin, cause attaching-effacing (A/E) lesions in intestinal epithelial cells, and possess a specific 60-MDa EHEC plasmid are known as EHEC. One feature EHEC and EPEC have in common is the causation of intestinal epithelial lesions known as attaching and effacing (A/E). Attaching-effacing E coli (AEEC) is a designation for those E coli strains known to cause A/E lesions or at least carry the genes for this trait, and therefore include organisms that fall into either the EHEC or EPEC classes. Because cattle are carriers of many different serotypes of EHEC, much emphasis has been placed on the public health and food safety concerns associated with the fecal shedding of these organisms. However, much less emphasis has been given to their roles as diarrheagenic pathogens of cattle.

Truncated trimers composed of its neck and carbohydrate recognition domains (NCRDs) bind various ligands; however, they have minimal inhibitory activity for IAV. We have sought to find ways to increase the antiviral activity of collectin NCRDs. Cross-linking of the SP-D NCRD with nonblocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) markedly potentiates antiviral activity. In the present report, we demonstrate that F(ab')2 [but not F(ab')1] fragments of a cross-linking mAb have similar effects. Hence, cross-linking activity, but not the Fc domain of the mAb, is needed for increased antiviral activity. In contrast, the Fc domain of the mAb was important for increasing viral uptake or respiratory burst responses of human neutrophils. Our NCRD constructs contain an S protein binding site. Herein, we show that a multivalent S protein complex caused cross-linking and also increased the antiviral activity of NCRDs. NCRDs of conglutinin and CL43 had greater intrinsic antiviral activity than those of SP-D or mannose-binding lectin. Based on motifs found in these serum collectins, we have constructed mutant versions of the human SP-D NCRD that have increased antiviral activity. These mutant NCRDs also had potentiated activity after cross-linking with F(ab')2 fragments or S protein complexes. Hence, the antiviral activity of NCRDs can be increased by 2 distinct, complementary strategies, namely cross-linking of NCRDs through various means and mutagenesis of CRD residues to increase viral binding.

Biotinylated and fluorescently labeled double-stranded (ds) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) amplification products are generated in a 100 nL PCR reactor incorporating an integrated heater and a temperature sensor. After amplification, the products are captured and concentrated in a cross-linked acrylamide gel capture matrix copolymerized with acrydite-functionalized streptavidin-capture agents.

Using plasmid standards containing the viral genes of interest, each target can be detected starting from as few as 10 copies/reactor. When a two-step reverse transcription PCR amplification is employed, the device can detect ribonucleic acid (RNA) analogues of all four viral targets with detection limits in the range of 25-100 copies/reactor.

Although purine itself has never been found in nature, substituted purines, such as adenine and guanine, or their respective nucleoside derivatives, adenosine and guanosine, are the most ubiquitous class of nitrogen heterocycles and play crucial roles in wide variety of functions of living beings As nucleotides (AMP,GMP), they are the building blocks of nucleic acids (RNA/DNA). They serve as energy cofactors (ATP, GTP), as part of coenzymes (NAD/FAD) in oxidation-reduction reactions, as important second messengers in many intracellular signal transduction processes (cAMP/cGMP), or as direct neurotransmitters by binding to purinergic receptors (adenosine receptors). Therefore, it is not surprising that the analogues of purines have found utility both as chemotherapeutics (antiviral, antibiotic, and anticancer agents) and pharmacodynamic entities (the regulation of myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac blood flow). While they can act as substrates or the inhibitors of the enzymes of purine metabolism to render their chemotherapeutic action, their ability to act as agonists or antagonists of A1/A2A receptors is the basis for the modulation of pharmacodynamic property.",2009-12-31,"Hosmane,RamachandraS.",ProgressinHeterocyclicChemistry,83508198,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959638009700297;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959638009700297,0o4tcj4e,

Implementing the gMMPI, this paper reviews the inequality of the coastal and non-coastal provinces, as well as the latent impact of scale efficiency change (SEC) for China. Using provincial data for the years 1996–2004, the empirical results are as follows. On average, China demonstrates an annual 3.191% productivity change, which is lower than 4.729% for the conventional MPI and accounts for about 26.508% of output growth over the period 1996–2004. Most of this change is propelled by technical progress, while a fraction is driven by the adjustment in production scale, and the efficiency change has an adverse effect. Furthermore, regional inequality is also found in this empirical work, and the productivity change of the coastal region is actually stronger than that of the non-coastal region. This paper also casts some focus on the China Western Development policy. Indeed, we do not find any outstanding achievement from the policy in the sample period, except that the west region sustained its rate of productivity change after 2000. Moreover, the SEC is found to be trivial in the advanced coastal region, but plays an important role in the relatively laggard non-coastal region. The implication of the positive SEC in the non-coastal region means that China's Western Development policy will improve the scale efficiency and the TFP growth of the west region.",2009-12-31,"Chen,Ku-Hsieh;Huang,Yi-Ju;Yang,Chih-Hai",ChinaEconomicReview,55883964,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043951X09000467;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X09000467,10t50mp7,

Contactors with SARS patients and those with symptom development following the contacts were investigated via questionnaire. Serum samples were collected from super transmitters and tested for SARS-CoV antibody by neutralization test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results A total of 1 112 contactors were investigated in three surveys.

Mice are continuous, polyestrous rodents that should be bred in polygamous or monogamous setups because of the males' aggressive territoriality behavior. When breeding mice that have been housed in a polygamous ratio, there may be one male with two to six females. Females are removed from a polygamous cage before parturition, whereas the monogamous pair is maintained together with the young until weaning. Mice are maintained in environments that are similar to other small rodents but require a thorough cleaning of their cage more often because of their malodorous urine. Ventilation is essential for small rodent housing to prevent irritation of the respiratory tract from ammonia vapors generated by urine. Quarantining is important when a new animal is being introduced into a setting in which there is an established group. As with other animals, a 30-day quarantine period is recommended, along with a physical examination and fecal parasite check. To maintain oversight of breeding animals' health and reduce the exposure of young animals to infectious disease and parasites, routine screening of representative animals within the colony is recommended.

Furthermore, while pre-treating cells with ATA failed to inhibit viral replication, pre-incubation of virus with ATA effectively reduced viral titers, suggesting that ATA may elicit its inhibitory effects by directly interacting with the virus. Electron microscopy revealed that ATA induced viral aggregation at the cell surface, prompting us to determine if ATA could inhibit neuraminidase. ATA was found to compromise the activities of virus-derived and recombinant neuraminidase. Moreover, an oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 strain with H274Y was also found to be sensitive to ATA. Finally, we observed additive protective value when infected cells were simultaneously treated with ATA and amantadine hydrochloride, an anti-influenza drug that inhibits M2-ion channels of influenza A virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these data suggest that ATA is a potent anti-influenza agent by directly inhibiting the neuraminidase and could be a more effective antiviral compound when used in combination with amantadine hydrochloride.",2009-12-17,"Hashem,AnwarM.;Flaman,AnatheaS.;Farnsworth,Aaron;Brown,EarlG.;VanDomselaar,Gary;He,Runtao;Li,Xuguang",PLoSOne,6241166,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20020057/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008350,13bvkj2t,

To combat against this pathogen, immune cells release cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which is pivotal in the development of protective granulomas. Our previous results showed that Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), a mycobacterium used as a model to investigate the immune response against MTB, stimulates the induction of TNF-α via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in human blood monocytes. Since MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is known to regulate MAPK activities, we examined whether MKP-1 plays a role in BCG-induced MAPK activation and cytokine expression. RESULTS: Primary human blood monocytes were treated with BCG and assayed for MKP-1 expression. Our results demonstrated that following exposure to BCG, there was an increase in the expression of MKP-1. Additionally, the induction of MKP-1 was regulated by p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Surprisingly, when MKP-1 expression was blocked by its specific siRNA, there was a significant decrease in the levels of phospho-MAPK (p38 MAPK and ERK1/2) and TNF-α inducible by BCG.

Visual capabilities are conferred by anatomical features of the eyes as well as the combination and properties of their constituent light sensitive pigments. To test whether evolutionary switches to different niches characterized by dim-light conditions coincided with molecular adaptation of the rod pigment rhodopsin, we sequenced the rhodopsin gene in twenty-two mammals including several bats and subterranean mole-rats. We compared these to thirty-seven published mammal rhodopsin sequences, from species with divergent visual ecologies, including nocturnal, diurnal and aquatic groups. All taxa possessed an intact functional rhodopsin; however, phylogenetic tree reconstruction recovered a gene tree in which rodents were not monophyletic, and also in which echolocating bats formed a monophyletic group. These conflicts with the species tree appear to stem from accelerated evolution in these groups, both of which inhabit low light environments. Selection tests confirmed divergent selection pressures in the clades of subterranean rodents and bats, as well as in marine mammals that live in turbid conditions. We also found evidence of divergent selection pressures among groups of bats with different sensory modalities based on vision and echolocation. Sliding window analyses suggest most changes occur in transmembrane domains, particularly obvious within the pinnipeds; however, we found no obvious pattern between photopic niche and predicted spectral sensitivity based on known critical amino acids. This study indicates that the independent evolution of rhodopsin vision in ecologically specialised groups of mammals has involved molecular evolution at the sequence level, though such changes might not mediate spectral sensitivity directly.",2009-12-16,"Zhao,Huabin;Ru,Binghua;Teeling,EmmaC.;Faulkes,ChristopherG.;Zhang,Shuyi;Rossiter,StephenJ.",PLoSOne,15765896,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008326;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20016835/,02uqygfs,

Anthropogenic contaminants are one of multiple stressors affecting this system, and among them, current-use insecticides are of major concern. Interrogative tools are required to successfully monitor effects of contaminants on the delta smelt, and to research potential causes of population decline in this species. We have created a microarray to investigate genome-wide effects of potentially causative stressors, and applied this tool to assess effects of the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate on larval delta smelt. Selected genes were further investigated as molecular biomarkers using quantitative PCR analyses. RESULTS: Exposure to esfenvalerate affected swimming behavior of larval delta smelt at concentrations as low as 0.0625 μg.L(-1), and significant differences in expression were measured in genes involved in neuromuscular activity. Alterations in the expression of genes associated with immune responses, along with apoptosis, redox, osmotic stress, detoxification, and growth and development appear to have been invoked by esfenvalerate exposure. Swimming impairment correlated significantly with expression of aspartoacylase (ASPA), an enzyme involved in brain cell function and associated with numerous human diseases. Selected genes were investigated for their use as molecular biomarkers, and strong links were determined between measured downregulation in ASPA and observed behavioral responses in fish exposed to environmentally relevant pyrethroid concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that microarray technology is a useful approach in screening for, and generation of molecular biomarkers in endangered, non-model organisms, identifying specific genes that can be directly linked with sublethal toxicological endpoints; such as changes in expression levels of neuromuscular genes resulting in measurable swimming impairments. The developed microarrays were successfully applied on larval fish exposed to esfenvalerate, a known contaminant of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary, and has permitted the identification of specific biomarkers which could provide insight into the factors contributing to delta smelt population decline.",2009-12-15,"Connon,RichardE;Geist,Juergen;Pfeiff,Janice;Loguinov,AlexanderV;D'Abronzo,LeandroS;Wintz,Henri;Vulpe,ChristopherD;Werner,Inge",BMCGenomics,3569437,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-10-608;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20003521/,1ecqnstz,

We used simulation approaches to reproduce three actual cases where groups of hospital occupants reported to be either infected or not infected when SARS patients were hospitalized in nearby rooms. Simulations using both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multi-zone models were carried out to understand the dilution level of SARS virus-laden aerosols during these scenarios. We also conducted a series of measurements to validate the simulations. The ventilation rates (dilution level) for infection and non-infection were determined based on these scenarios. The safe ventilation rate for eliminating airborne viral infection is to dilute the air emitted from a SARS patient by 10000 times with clean air. Dilution at lower volumes, specifically 1000 times, is insufficient for protecting non-infected people from SARS exposure and the risk of infection is very high.

Adaptation, driven by selection pressure in human hosts, can play a significant role in allowing pathogens to cross this species barrier. Here we use a simple mathematical model to study potential epidemiological markers of adaptation. We ask: under what circumstances could ongoing adaptation be signalled by large clusters of human infection? If a pathogen has caused hundreds of cases but with little transmission, does this indicate that the species barrier cannot be crossed? Finally, how can case reports be monitored to detect an imminent emergence event? We distinguish evolutionary scenarios under which adaptation is likely to be signalled by large clusters of infection and under which emergence is likely to occur without any prior warning. Moreover, we show that a lack of transmission never rules out adaptability, regardless of how many zoonoses have occurred. Indeed, after the first 100 zoonotic cases, continuing sporadic zoonotic infections without onward, human-to-human transmission offer little extra information on pathogen adaptability.

Peptidases are important in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tumour and parasite invasion, and for processing viral polyproteins. The MEROPS database is an Internet resource containing information on peptidases, their substrates and inhibitors. The database now includes details of cleavage positions in substrates, both physiological and non-physiological, natural and synthetic. There are 39 118 cleavages in the collection; including 34 606 from a total of 10 513 different proteins and 2677 cleavages in synthetic substrates. The number of cleavages designated as ‘physiological’ is 13 307. The data are derived from 6095 publications. At least one substrate cleavage is known for 45% of the 2415 different peptidases recognized in the MEROPS database. The website now has three new displays: two showing peptidase specificity as a logo and a frequency matrix, the third showing a dynamically generated alignment between each protein substrate and its most closely related homologues. Many of the proteins described in the literature as peptidase substrates have been studied only in vitro. On the assumption that a physiologically relevant cleavage site would be conserved between species, the conservation of every site in terms of peptidase preference has been examined and a number have been identified that are not conserved. There are a number of cogent reasons why a site might not be conserved. Each poorly conserved site has been examined and a reason postulated. Some sites are identified that are very poorly conserved where cleavage is more likely to be fortuitous than of physiological relevance. This data-set is freely available via the Internet and is a useful training set for algorithms to predict substrates for peptidases and cleavage positions within those substrates. The data may also be useful for the design of inhibitors and for engineering novel specificities into peptidases.

Methods The HPS was positioned at 45° on the bed and programmed to mimic mild lung injury (oxygen consumption, 300 mL/min; lung compliance, 35 mL/cm H2O). Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) started at 10 cm H2O and gradually increased to 18 cm H2O, whereas expiratory pressure was maintained at 4 cm H2O. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet, and images were captured by high definition video. Normalized exhaled air concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by the smoke particles. Findings As IPAP increased from 10 to 18 cm H2O, the exhaled air of a low normalized concentration through the ComfortFull 2 mask (Respironics) increased from 0.65 to 0.85 m at a direction perpendicular to the head of the HPS along the median sagittal plane. When the IPAP of 10 cm H2O was applied via the Image 3 mask (Respironics) connected to the whisper swivel, the exhaled air dispersed to 0.95 m toward the end of the bed along the median sagittal plane, whereas higher IPAP resulted in wider spread of a higher concentration of smoke.

The objectives of this study were to determine the barriers and supports to implementing MDI/spacer research and to identify factors associated with early and late adoption of MDI/spacers in Canadian PEDs. METHODS: Using a comparative case study design, we classified nine tertiary care pediatric hospital PEDs based on their stage of implementation. Data were collected using focus group interviews with physicians, registered nurses (RNs), and respiratory therapists (RTs), and individual interviews with both patient care and medical directors at each site. Initial coding was based on the Ottawa Model of Research Use (OMRU) categories of elements known to influence the uptake of innovations. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty healthcare professionals from nine different healthcare institutions participated in this study. Lack of leadership in the form of a research champion, a lack of consensus about the benefits of MDI/spacers among staff, perceived resistance from patients/parents, and perceived increased cost and workload associated with MDI/spacer use were the most prevalent barriers to the adoption of the MDI/spacer.

Measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, assessed estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumption RESULTS: 26% of the respondents were 'very concerned' about being a flu victim (42% Malaysians, 5% Europeans, p < .001). 36% reported reduced public transport use (48% Malaysia, 22% Europe, p < .001), 39% flight cancellations (56% Malaysia, 17% Europe, p < .001). 8% had purchased preparatory materials (e.g. face masks: 8% Malaysia, 7% Europe), 41% Malaysia (15% Europe) intended to do so (p < .001). 63% of Europeans, 19% of Malaysians had discussed the pandemic with friends (p < .001).

In data collected only in Europe, 64% greatly underestimated the mortality rates of seasonal flu, 26% believed seasonal flu vaccination gave protection against swine flu. 7% had reduced/stopped eating pork. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home, while 32% intended to do so if the pandemic worsened. CONCLUSION: Initial responses to Influenza A show large regional differences in anxiety, with Malaysians more anxious and more likely to reduce travel and to buy masks and food. Discussions with family and friends may reinforce existing anxiety levels. Particular groups (homosexuals, prostitutes, the homeless) are perceived as at greater risk, potentially leading to increased prejudice during a pandemic.

Because the list of γ-secretase substrates is growing quickly and this enzyme is a cancer and Alzheimer's disease therapeutic target, the mapping of γ-secretase activity susceptible gene transcription is important for sharpening our view of specific affected genes, molecular functions and biological pathways. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify genes and molecular functions transcriptionally affected by γ-secretase activity, the cellular transcriptomes of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with enhanced and inhibited γ-secretase activity were analyzed and compared by cDNA microarray. The functional clustering by FatiGO of the 1,981 identified genes revealed over- and under-represented groups with multiple activities and functions. Single genes with the most pronounced transcriptional susceptibility to γ-secretase activity were evaluated by real-time PCR. Among the 21 validated genes, the strikingly decreased transcription of PTPRG and AMN1 and increased transcription of UPP1 potentially support data on cell cycle disturbances relevant to cancer, stem cell and neurodegenerative diseases' research. The mapping of interactions of proteins encoded by the validated genes exclusively relied on evidence-based data and revealed broad effects on Wnt pathway members, including WNT3A and DVL3. Intriguingly, the transcription of TERA, a gene of unknown function, is affected by γ-secretase activity and was significantly altered in the analyzed human Alzheimer's disease brain cortices.

Sensitivity was calculated as the number of influenza positive tests divided by the number of influenza positive tests plus the model-estimated number of false negative tests. The sensitivity of influenza testing was estimated to be 33% (95%CI 32–34%), varying from 30–40% depending on the season and region.

We determined the reproduction number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by analyzing the dynamics of the complete case series in Mexico City during this early period. Methods We analyzed three mutually exclusive datasets from Mexico City Distrito Federal which constituted all suspect cases from 15 March to 25 April: confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections, non‐pandemic influenza A infections and patients who tested negative for influenza. We estimated the initial reproduction number from 497 suspect cases identified prior to 20 April, using a novel contact network methodology incorporating dates of symptom onset and hospitalization, variation in contact rates, extrinsic sociological factors, and uncertainties in underreporting and disease progression. We tested the robustness of this estimate using both the subset of laboratory‐confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections and an extended case series through 25 April, adjusted for suspected ascertainment bias. Results The initial reproduction number (95% confidence interval range) for this novel virus is 1·51 (1·32–1·71) based on suspected cases and 1·43 (1·29–1·57) based on confirmed cases before 20 April. The longer time series (through 25 April) yielded a higher estimate of 2·04 (1·84–2·25), which reduced to 1·44 (1·38–1·51) after correction for ascertainment bias.

These viruses are widespread and can be grouped in several types. Understanding the evolutionary history of HPeV could answer questions such as how long the circulating lineages last shared a common ancestor and how the evolution of this viral species is shaped by its population dynamics. Using both strict and relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics we investigated 1) the substitutions rates of the structural P1 and capsid VP1 regions and 2) evolutionary timescale of currently circulating HPeV lineages. RESULTS: Our estimates reveal that human parechoviruses exhibit high substitution rates for both structural P1 and capsid VP1 regions, respectively 2.21 × 10(-3 )(0.48 – 4.21 × 10(-3)) and 2.79 × 10(-3 )(2.05 – 3.66 × 10(-3)) substitutions per site per year. These are within the range estimated for other picornaviruses. By employing a constant population size coalescent prior, the date of the most recent common ancestor was estimated to be at around 1600 (1427–1733). In addition, by looking at the frequency of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions within the VP1 gene we show that purifying selection constitutes the dominating evolutionary force leading to strong amino acid conservation.

Three trans-membrane non-structural proteins, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6, are understood to be membrane anchors of the coronavirus replication complex. Nsp4 is localized to the ER membrane when expressed alone but is recruited into the replication complex in infected cells. It is revealed to contain four trans-membrane regions and its N- and C-termini are exposed to the cytosol. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have determined the crystal structures of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of nsp4 (nsp4C) from MHV strain A59 and a C425S site-directed mutant. The highly conserved 89 amino acid region from T408 to Q496 is shown to possess a new fold. The wild-type (WT) structure features two monomers linked by a Cys425-Cys425 disulfide bond in one asymmetric unit. The monomers are arranged with their N- and C-termini in opposite orientations to form an “open” conformation. Mutation of Cys425 to Ser did not affect the monomer structure, although the mutant dimer adopts strikingly different conformations by crystal packing, with the cross-linked C-termini and parallel N-termini of two monomers forming a “closed” conformation. The WT nsp4C exists as a dimer in solution and can dissociate easily into monomers in a reducing environment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As nsp4C is exposed in the reducing cytosol, the monomer of nsp4C should be physiological. This structure may serve as a basis for further functional studies of nsp4.",2009-07-10,"Xu,Xiaoling;Lou,Zhiyong;Ma,Yanlin;Chen,Xuehui;Yang,Zhangsheng;Tong,Xiaohang;Zhao,Qi;Xu,Yuanyuan;Deng,Hongyu;Bartlam,Mark;Rao,Zihe",PLoSOne,3873917,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19593433/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006217,1beonuh7,

Absence, or inactivation, of E protein results in attenuated viruses, due to alterations in either virion morphology or tropism. Apart from its morphogenetic properties, protein E has been reported to have membrane permeabilizing activity. Further, the drug hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not amiloride, inhibited in vitro ion channel activity of some synthetic coronavirus E proteins, and also viral replication. We have previously shown for the coronavirus species responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) that the transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms pentameric α-helical bundles that are likely responsible for the observed channel activity. Herein, using solution NMR in dodecylphosphatidylcholine micelles and energy minimization, we have obtained a model of this channel which features regular α-helices that form a pentameric left-handed parallel bundle. The drug HMA was found to bind inside the lumen of the channel, at both the C-terminal and the N-terminal openings, and, in contrast to amiloride, induced additional chemical shifts in ETM. Full length SARS-CoV E displayed channel activity when transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells in a whole-cell patch clamp set-up. This activity was significantly reduced by hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not by amiloride.

Eight aminoazocompounds and 27 aryltriazene derivatives exhibited antiviral activity, sometimes of high level, against one or more viruses. A marked activity against BVDV and YFV was prevailing among the former compounds, while the latter type of compounds affected mainly CVB-2 and RSV. None of the active compounds inhibited the multiplication of HIV-1, VSV and VV. Arranged in order of decreasing potency and selectivity versus the host cell lines, the best compounds are the following; BVDV: 1 > 7 > 8 > 4; YFV: 7 > 5; CVB-2: 25 > 56 > 18; RSV: 14 > 20 > 55 > 38 > 18 > 19; HSV-1: 2.

Non-responders were re-mailed the questionnaire on two further occasions, 2 and 4 weeks after the first posting. Completed questionnaires were received from 884 households. No pets were kept by 387 (43.8%) respondents. Dogs and cats were owned by 295 (33.4%) and 198 (22.5%) of households, respectively, with 7.8% of households having both cat(s) and dog(s). Fish and birds were the next most popular pets. Of the 198 cat-owning households, 54.0% kept only cat(s), while 46.5% kept cats with other pets. The distribution of cat ownership across Sydney was non-uniform. Each cat-owning household kept 1.3 cats on average, with the majority keeping one (75.8% households) or two (18.7%). For the 260 cats, the mean age was 7.1 years, the median 6 years, with a range of 3 months to 22 years. There were significantly more female (143; 55%) than male cats (117; 45%). Only seven cats (2.7%) were sexually entire, and these were all ≤6 years. Crossbred cats outnumbered pedigree cats by a ratio of 3.3:1. The Burmese was the most common breed, followed by the Persian. The median age of pedigree cats (5.5 years) was significantly lower than for domestic crossbred cats (7.0 years). Most cats were housed both indoors and outdoors (72.6%), with 19.7% being restricted to indoors and/or ‘pet park enclosures’. Pedigree cats were significantly more likely than crossbreds to be housed indoors. Most owners fed their cats a combination of commercial dry and canned food (38.1%), although fresh meat was popular also and either fed alone (1.6%) or in combination with dry food (14.4%), tinned food (1.6%) or canned and dry food (25.8%). A diet consisting of dry food alone was fed to cats in 13.4% of households. Ninety percent of cats had been vaccinated at least once, while 72.2% received a vaccination in the last 3 years.

The last major international assessment of these impacts was made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1999. Here, a comprehensive updated assessment of aviation is provided. Scientific advances since the 1999 assessment have reduced key uncertainties, sharpening the quantitative evaluation, yet the basic conclusions remain the same. The climate impact of aviation is driven by long-term impacts from CO(2) emissions and shorter-term impacts from non-CO(2) emissions and effects, which include the emissions of water vapour, particles and nitrogen oxides (NO(x)). The present-day radiative forcing from aviation (2005) is estimated to be 55 mW m(−2) (excluding cirrus cloud enhancement), which represents some 3.5% (range 1.3–10%, 90% likelihood range) of current anthropogenic forcing, or 78 mW m(−2) including cirrus cloud enhancement, representing 4.9% of current forcing (range 2–14%, 90% likelihood range). According to two SRES-compatible scenarios, future forcings may increase by factors of 3–4 over 2000 levels, in 2050. The effects of aviation emissions of CO(2) on global mean surface temperature last for many hundreds of years (in common with other sources), whilst its non-CO(2) effects on temperature last for decades. Much progress has been made in the last ten years on characterizing emissions, although major uncertainties remain over the nature of particles. Emissions of NO(x) result in production of ozone, a climate warming gas, and the reduction of ambient methane (a cooling effect) although the overall balance is warming, based upon current understanding. These NO(x) emissions from current subsonic aviation do not appear to deplete stratospheric ozone. Despite the progress made on modelling aviation's impacts on tropospheric chemistry, there remains a significant spread in model results. The knowledge of aviation's impacts on cloudiness has also improved: a limited number of studies have demonstrated an increase in cirrus cloud attributable to aviation although the magnitude varies: however, these trend analyses may be impacted by satellite artefacts. The effect of aviation particles on clouds (with and without contrails) may give rise to either a positive forcing or a negative forcing: the modelling and the underlying processes are highly uncertain, although the overall effect of contrails and enhanced cloudiness is considered to be a positive forcing and could be substantial, compared with other effects. The debate over quantification of aviation impacts has also progressed towards studying potential mitigation and the technological and atmospheric tradeoffs. Current studies are still relatively immature and more work is required to determine optimal technological development paths, which is an aspect that atmospheric science has much to contribute. In terms of alternative fuels, liquid hydrogen represents a possibility and may reduce some of aviation's impacts on climate if the fuel is produced in a carbon-neutral way: such fuel is unlikely to be utilized until a ‘hydrogen economy’ develops. The introduction of biofuels as a means of reducing CO(2) impacts represents a future possibility. However, even over and above land-use concerns and greenhouse gas budget issues, aviation fuels require strict adherence to safety standards and thus require extra processing compared with biofuels destined for other sectors, where the uptake of such fuel may be more beneficial in the first instance.",2009-06-12,"Lee,D.S.;Pitari,G.;Grewe,V.;Gierens,K.;Penner,J.E.;Petzold,A.;Prather,M.J.;Schumann,U.;Bais,A.;Berntsen,T.;Iachetti,D.;Lim,L.L.;Sausen,R.",AtmosEnviron(1994),98001060,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288556/;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231009004956;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2009.06.005;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231009004956,15tjo6n0,

We have previously reported that dendritic cells (DCs) might be involved in the immune escape mechanisms for SARS-CoV. In this study, we focussed on the gene expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), chemokine receptors (CCRs) and death receptor ligands in SARS-CoV infected DCs. We also compared adult and cord blood (CB) DCs to find a possible explanation for the age-dependent severity of SARS. RESULTS: Our results demonstrates that SARS-CoV did not modulate TLR-1 to TLR-10 gene expression but significantly induced the expression of CCR-1, CCR-3, and CCR-5. There was also strong induction of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), but not Fas ligand gene expression in SARS-CoV infected DCs. Interestingly, the expressions of most genes studied were higher in CB DCs than adult DCs. CONCLUSION: The upregulation of chemokines and CCRs may facilitate DC migration from the infection site to the lymph nodes, whereas the increase of TRAIL may induce lymphocyte apoptosis.

After excluding orthopedic and cardiovascular diseases that may mimic a neurological condition, the clinician has to address a long list of different diseases that may affect the spinal cord and produce paresis. Clinical challenges In many cases a definitive cause of spinal weakness in cats is difficult to prove. Even when treatable diseases are identified, the prognosis is very much dependent on the severity of the clinical signs and their chronicity. This review sets out to describe the specific approach, diagnosis and management of cats with spinal cord disease and to outline the most common diseases responsible. Patient group Patients of either gender and all ages and breeds can be affected by spinal cord disease. Evidence base Many diseases affecting the spinal cord of cats, which include fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy, intervertebral disc disease, exogenous spinal cord trauma, spinal cord lymphosarcoma and feline infectious peritonitis, are well described in the literature.

However, within the large Nsp3 (1922 amino-acid residues), the structure and function of the so-called SARS-unique domain (SUD) have remained elusive. SUD occurs only in SARS-CoV and the highly related viruses found in certain bats, but is absent from all other coronaviruses. Therefore, it has been speculated that it may be involved in the extreme pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, compared to other coronaviruses, most of which cause only mild infections in humans. In order to help elucidate the function of the SUD, we have determined crystal structures of fragment 389–652 (“SUD(core)”) of Nsp3, which comprises 264 of the 338 residues of the domain. Both the monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms (2.2 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively) revealed that SUD(core) forms a homodimer. Each monomer consists of two subdomains, SUD-N and SUD-M, with a macrodomain fold similar to the SARS-CoV X-domain. However, in contrast to the latter, SUD fails to bind ADP-ribose, as determined by zone-interference gel electrophoresis. Instead, the entire SUD(core) as well as its individual subdomains interact with oligonucleotides known to form G-quadruplexes. This includes oligodeoxy- as well as oligoribonucleotides. Mutations of selected lysine residues on the surface of the SUD-N subdomain lead to reduction of G-quadruplex binding, whereas mutations in the SUD-M subdomain abolish it. As there is no evidence for Nsp3 entering the nucleus of the host cell, the SARS-CoV genomic RNA or host-cell mRNA containing long G-stretches may be targets of SUD. The SARS-CoV genome is devoid of G-stretches longer than 5–6 nucleotides, but more extended G-stretches are found in the 3′-nontranslated regions of mRNAs coding for certain host-cell proteins involved in apoptosis or signal transduction, and have been shown to bind to SUD in vitro. Therefore, SUD may be involved in controlling the host cell's response to the viral infection. Possible interference with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-like domains is also discussed.",2009-05-15,"Tan,Jinzhi;Vonrhein,Clemens;Smart,OliverS.;Bricogne,Gerard;Bollati,Michela;Kusov,Yuri;Hansen,Guido;Mesters,JeroenR.;Schmidt,ChristianL.;Hilgenfeld,Rolf",PLoSPathog,17497149,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19436709/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000428,1aqt65cc,

The universal primers and specific TaqMan probes for each of the three genotypes, genotypes 1, 2, and 3, were designed within the 3′-UTR of the CSFV. Non-CSFV swine virus and clinical samples from specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were both demonstrated to be CSFV-negative by RT-MRT-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was determined to be 1 viral copy/μl for each genotype of standard plasmid. For the analytical sensitivity experiment, 100 samples of 14 CSFV genotype 1 strains and 86 samples from CSFV outbreak farms were all detected as CSFV-positive by RT-MRT-PCR, and the genotype results were consistent with the results of sequencing from a previous study. The intra-assay and inter-assay variations of RT-MRT-PCR were below 3% in all experiments. The sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was the same as the reverse transcription nested PCR (RT-nPCR) and higher than reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and viral isolation from clinical samples. This assay was used further to evaluate the duration of viremia of wild-type CSFV in vaccinated exposed pigs.

The dengue virus is a single-stranded RNA virus with four major serotypes. Infection with one serotype confers homotypic immunity but not heterologous immunity, and secondary infection with another serotype may lead to more severe disease. The major route of transmission occurs through the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector, but dengue has also been transmitted through blood transfusion and organ transplantation. Infection results in a spectrum of clinical illness ranging from asymptomatic infection, undifferentiated fever, dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) to dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Dengue is spreading rapidly to new areas and with increasing frequency of major outbreaks. A trend has also been observed towards increasing age among infected patients. This will impact blood supply availability as more blood donors are deferred because of dengue infection or exposure to infection. The risk of transmission through transfusion of blood from asymptomatic viraemic donors will also increase. Although screening tests for dengue and effective pathogen reduction processes are now available for the blood supply, the value of implementing these costly measures needs to be carefully considered.

In LMIC, three types of public health training have been tried: the university-based model; streamed training for specialised workers; and field-based programs. The first has low rates of production and teaching may not always be based on the needs and priorities of the host country. The second model is efficient, but does not accord the workers sufficient status to enable them to impact on policy. The third has the most potential as a capacity development measure for LMIC, but in practice faces challenges which may limit its ability to promote capacity development. DISCUSSION: We describe Australia's first Master of Applied Epidemiology (MAE) model (established in 1991), which uses field-based training to strengthen the control of communicable diseases. A central attribute of this model is the way it partners and complements health department initiatives to enhance workforce skills, health system performance and the evidence-base for policies, programs and practice. SUMMARY: The MAE experience throws light on ways Australia could collaborate in regional capacity development initiatives. Key needs are a shared vision for a regional approach to integrate training with initiatives that strengthen service and research, and the pooling of human, financial and technical resources.

The Nearest neighbour hierarchical (Nnh) and Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) techniques can offer additional insights about the circumstances and environmental factors that contribute to falls. The results affirm the multi-factorial nature of falls at specific locations and for selected groups of the population. CONCLUSION: The techniques to detect hot spots of falls yield meaningful results that enable the identification of high risk locations. The combined use of descriptive and spatial analyses can be beneficial to policy makers because different preventive measures can be devised based on the types of environmental risk factors identified. The analyses are also important preludes to establishing research hypotheses for more focused studies.",2009-03-17,"Lai,PohC;Low,ChienT;Wong,Martin;Wong,WingC;Chan,MingH",IntJHealthGeogr,22110055,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19291326/;https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-072x-8-14,22s9umrj,

Del conjunto y de la interacción de estas partes involucradas depende la respuesta y la gestión de las crisis, tanto en sentido negativo como positivo. Se demuestra que la respuesta a las crisis ha sido heterogénea, como sus efectos en la salud, que suelen acentuar las desigualdades. La información y su tratamiento modulan las demandas de ayuda sanitaria. La participación y la coordinación con los servicios asistenciales ha sido también muy variable, aunque éstos son fundamentales para la detección de las crisis y permiten una influencia positiva en la población. Dada la demostrada escasa influencia de los profesionales de salud pública, se deduce la relevancia de su intervención activa ante las crisis, ya que su nexo con los políticos y los medios de comunicación es clave en la gestión de los problemas de salud pública. Las crisis son retos de los que debemos aprender, tanto de los errores como de los éxitos, pues sirven para poner a punto los dispositivos y perfeccionar nuestra respuesta ante otras crisis.

Abstract Health crises shock the population and overwhelm the health services. This article analyzes 30 years of health crises in Spain from a multifaceted perspective: population, patients, clinicians, public health practitioners, politicians, the media and other groups involved. The interaction among all stakeholders shapes the response and management of any health crisis. Heterogeneity of management and of health effects–contributing to inequalities in health-is common. The participation and coordination of the health services is crucial in detection of the crisis and in modulating the population reactions. Public health services characterized by their low public profile could gain public influence by their role in coordinating politicians and the media when solving important health problems.

However, this process is inefficient. Experiments were therefore conducted to delineate the rate limiting step(s) involved, using a phage vector that contains a mammalian luciferase reporter gene cassette. The efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer in mammalian cells was quantitated, in the presence or absence of pharmacologic inhibitors of cell uptake and degradation pathways. Inhibitors of lysosomal proteases and proteasome inhibitors strongly enhanced phage-mediated luciferase expression, suggesting that these pathways contribute to the destruction of intracellular phage particles. In contrast, inhibition of endosome acidification had no effect on phage-mediated gene transfer, presumably because phage lambda is tolerant to extended exposure to low pH. These findings provide insights into the pathways by which phage vectors enter and transduce mammalian cells, and suggest that it may be possible to pharmacologically enhance the efficiency of phage-mediated gene transfer in mammalian cells.

We applied a “next-generation” parallel sequencing platform for viral detection in nasopharyngeal and fecal samples collected during seasonal influenza virus (Flu) infections and norovirus outbreaks from 2005 to 2007 in Osaka, Japan. Random RT-PCR was performed to amplify RNA extracted from 0.1–0.25 ml of nasopharyngeal aspirates (N = 3) and fecal specimens (N = 5), and more than 10 µg of cDNA was synthesized. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of these 8 samples yielded 15,298–32,335 (average 24,738) reads in a single 7.5 h run. In nasopharyngeal samples, although whole genome analysis was not available because the majority (>90%) of reads were host genome–derived, 20–460 Flu-reads were detected, which was sufficient for subtype identification. In fecal samples, bacteria and host cells were removed by centrifugation, resulting in gain of 484–15,260 reads of norovirus sequence (78–98% of the whole genome was covered), except for one specimen that was under-detectable by RT-PCR. These results suggest that our unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach is useful for directly detecting pathogenic viruses without advance genetic information.

Such an atherogenic lipid profile often predisposes an at risk individual to coronary artery disease with incompletely understood mechanisms. Apolipoprotein D (apoD) is an atypical apolipoprotein. Unlike canonical apolipoproteins that are produced mainly in liver and intestine, apoD is expressed widely in mammalian tissues. ApoD does not share significant degrees of homology in amino acid sequence with other apolipoproteins. Instead, apoD is structurally similar to lipocalins, a diverse family of lipid-binding proteins that are responsible for transporting lipids and other small hydrophobic molecules for metabolism. Plasma ApoD is present mainly in HDL and to a lesser extent in low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Genetic variants of apoD are associated with abnormal lipid metabolism and increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Increased apoD deposition is detectable in atherosclerotic lesions of humans with established cardiovascular disease as well as mice with premature atherosclerosis. Moreover, apoD is associated with anti-oxidation and anti-stress activities, contributing to lifespan expansion in fruit flies. Elderly subjects and patients with Alzheimer exhibit markedly elevated apoD production in the brain. Thus, apoD is emerged as a significant player in lipid metabolism and aging. Here we focus our review on recent advances toward our understanding of apoD in lipid metabolism and address whether apoD dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. We will also discuss the functional implication of apoD in aging.",2008-12-12,"Perdomo,German;Dong,H.Henry",Aging(AlbanyNY),18889727,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19946382/,167z915s,

After 12 years follow-up of a cohort of 13 long-term non-progressors (LTNP) identified from 135 individuals with transfusion-acquired HIV infection, 5 remained LTNP after 23 to 26 years infection, but only 3 retained elite LTNP status. We examined the mechanisms that differentiated delayed progressors from LTNP in this cohort. RESULTS: A survival advantage was conferred on 12 of 13 subjects, who had at least one host genetic factor (HLA, chemokine receptor or TLR polymorphisms) or viral attenuating factor (defective nef) associated with slow progression. However, antiviral immune responses differentiated the course of disease into and beyond the second decade of infection. A stable p24-specific proliferative response was associated with control of viraemia and retention of non-progressor status, but this p24 response was absent or declined in viraemic subjects. Strong Gag-dominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses were identified in most LTNP, or Pol dominant-CTL in those with nef-defective HIV infection. CTL were associated with control of viraemia when combined with p24 proliferative responses. However, CTL did not prevent late disease progression. Individuals with sustained viral suppression had CTL recognising numerous Gag epitopes, while strong but restricted responses to one or two immunodominant epitopes was effective for some time, but failed to contain viraemia over the course of this study. Viral escape mutants at a HLA B27-restricted Gag-p24 epitope were detected in only 1 of 3 individuals, whereas declining or negative p24 proliferative responses occurred in all 3 concurrent with an increase in viraemia. CONCLUSION: Detectable viraemia at study entry was predictive of loss of LTNP status and/or disease progression in 6 of 8, and differentiated slow progressors from elite LTNP who retained potent virological control. Sustained immunological suppression of viraemia was independently associated with preserved p24 proliferative responses, regardless of the strength and breadth of the CTL response.

The shared outcome of spongiform degeneration in these diverse diseases suggests that common cellular mechanisms must underlie the processes of spongiform change and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissues reveals increased ubiquitin immunoreactivity in and around areas of spongiform change, suggesting the involvement of ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction in the pathogenesis of spongiform neurodegeneration. The link between aberrant ubiquitination and spongiform neurodegeneration has been strengthened by the discovery that a null mutation in the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase mahogunin ring finger-1 (Mgrn1) causes an autosomal recessively inherited form of spongiform neurodegeneration in animals. Recent studies have begun to suggest that abnormal ubiquitination may alter intracellular signaling and cell functions via proteasome-dependent and proteasome-independent mechanisms, leading to spongiform degeneration and neuronal cell death.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an ubiquitous opportunistic virus that is the most serious pathogenic agent in transplant patients. The available therapeutic armamentarium (e.g. HCMV hyperimmune globulins or antivirals) is associated with severe side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains; therefore, neutralizing human mAb may be a decisive alternative in the prevention of primary and re-activated HCMV infections in these patients. RESULTS: The purpose of this study was to generate neutralizing mAb against HCMV from the immunological repertoire of immune donors. To this aim, we designed an efficient technology relying on two discrete and sequential steps: first, human B-lymphocytes are stimulated with TLR9-agonists and IL-2; second, after both additives are removed, the cells are infected with EBV. Using this strategy we obtained 29 clones secreting IgG neutralizing the HCMV infectivity; four among these were further characterized. All of the mAbs neutralize the infection in different combinations of HCMV strains and target cells, with a potency ~20 fold higher than that of the HCMV hyperimmune globulins, currently used in transplant recipients. Recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 suitable as a prophylactic or therapeutic tool in clinical applications has been generated.

While immune defence may bring increased survival, this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits, including reproduction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating. In particular, we predicted that adult shrews, with shorter expected lifespans, would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined haemolymphatic tissues from wild-caught common shrews using light and transmission electron microscopy, applied in conjunction with immunohistology. We compared composition and function of these tissues in shrews of different ages, and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions observed in response to natural parasitic infections. All ages seemed able to mount systemic, specific immune responses, but adult shrews showed some signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion: lymphatic follicles in adults (n = 21) were both smaller than those in sub-adults (n = 18; Wald = 11.1, p<0.05) and exhibited greater levels of depletion (Wald = 13.3, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Contrary to our expectations, shrews respond effectively to their natural parasites, and show little indication of immunosenescence as adults. The pancreas of Aselli, a unique lymphoid organ, may aid in providing efficient immune responses through the storage of large numbers of plasma cells. This may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites, but infection by novel agents, and eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves, could both still be factors in the near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after breeding.",2008-10-15,"Bray,DanielP.;Bennett,Malcolm;Stockley,Paula;Hurst,JaneL.;Kipar,Anja",PLoSOne,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2561066/,104sqoxz,

We aimed to predict the effects of risk-factor trends on COPD, lung cancer, and tuberculosis. METHODS: We used representative data sources to estimate past trends in smoking and household solid-fuel use and to construct a range of future scenarios. We obtained the aetiological effects of risk factors on diseases from meta-analyses of epidemiological studies and from large studies in China. We modelled future COPD and lung cancer mortality and tuberculosis incidence, taking into account the accumulation of hazardous effects of risk factors on COPD and lung cancer over time, and dependency of the risk of tuberculosis infection on the prevalence of disease. We quantified the sensitivity of our results to methods and data choices. FINDINGS: If smoking and solid-fuel use remain at current levels between 2003 and 2033, 65 million deaths from COPD and 18 million deaths from lung cancer are predicted in China; 82% of COPD deaths and 75% of lung cancer deaths will be attributable to the combined effects of smoking and solid-fuel use. Complete gradual cessation of smoking and solid-fuel use by 2033 could avoid 26 million deaths from COPD and 6·3 million deaths from lung cancer; interventions of intermediate magnitude would reduce deaths by 6−31% (COPD) and 8−26% (lung cancer). Complete cessation of smoking and solid-fuel use by 2033 would reduce the projected annual tuberculosis incidence in 2033 by 14−52% if 80% DOTS coverage is sustained, 27−62% if 50% coverage is sustained, or 33−71% if 20% coverage is sustained. INTERPRETATION: Reducing smoking and solid-fuel use can substantially lower predictions of COPD and lung cancer burden and would contribute to effective tuberculosis control in China.

It compares research on media messages about MRSA with interview data gathered from a demographically diverse sample of 60 people interviewed from the Greater London area. Across the interview sample there was a shared consensus that most people associated MRSA not with the history of antibiotic use, but with dirty and poorly managed hospitals. Some media messages, such as blaming MRSA on the alleged ‘management culture’ of the NHS, seemed to capture the Zeitgeist, whereas others, in particular the ‘celebrity victims’ of MRSA, did not seem to resonate with the audience. This study also found that ideas based on scientific understandings about germ theory and the immune system were held alongside folklore such as miasmic theory. The comparison of media and mind thus points to the existence of pre-scientific understandings of germs, contagion and blame in parallel with the biomedical story in the minds of the public.

The denominators, the numbers of Japanese travelers visiting individual countries were derived from the recipient countries and obtained through a Japanese organization. RESULTS: In addition to the well-documented high risks in sub-Saharan countries, our study showed that travelers to Papua New Guinea were exposed to a significantly high risk of malaria.

Their replication complexes are commonly associated with modified host cell membranes. Membrane structures supporting viral RNA synthesis range from distinct spherular membrane invaginations to more elaborate webs of packed membranes and vesicles. Generally, their ultrastructure, morphogenesis, and exact role in viral replication remain to be defined. Poorly characterized double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) were previously implicated in SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. We have now applied electron tomography of cryofixed infected cells for the three-dimensional imaging of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution. Our analysis defines a unique reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that integrates convoluted membranes, numerous interconnected DMVs (diameter 200–300 nm), and “vesicle packets” apparently arising from DMV merger. The convoluted membranes were most abundantly immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits. However, double-stranded RNA, presumably revealing the site of viral RNA synthesis, mainly localized to the DMV interior. Since we could not discern a connection between DMV interior and cytosol, our analysis raises several questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. Our data document the extensive virus-induced reorganization of host cell membranes into a network that is used to organize viral replication and possibly hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms. Together with biochemical studies of the viral enzyme complex, our ultrastructural description of this “replication network” will aid to further dissect the early stages of the coronavirus life cycle and its virus-host interactions.",2008-09-16,"Knoops,Kèvin;Kikkert,Marjolein;vandenWorm,SjoerdH.E.;Zevenhoven-Dobbe,JessikaC;vanderMeer,Yvonne;Koster,AbrahamJ;Mommaas,A.Mieke;Snijder,EricJ",PLoSBiol,6622981,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18798692/;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060226,210dwhgj,

It is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the ganglia of the central and peripheral nervous system, leading to central nervous system disorders as well as disordered enteric motility and associated wasting. For almost 40 years, a viral etiology for PDD has been suspected, but to date no candidate etiologic agent has been reproducibly linked to the disease. RESULTS: Analysis of 2 PDD case-control series collected independently on different continents using a pan-viral microarray revealed a bornavirus hybridization signature in 62.5% of the PDD cases (5/8) and none of the controls (0/8). Ultra high throughput sequencing was utilized to recover the complete viral genome sequence from one of the virus-positive PDD cases. This revealed a bornavirus-like genome organization for this agent with a high degree of sequence divergence from all prior bornavirus isolates. We propose the name avian bornavirus (ABV) for this agent. Further specific ABV PCR analysis of an additional set of independently collected PDD cases and controls yielded a significant difference in ABV detection rate among PDD cases (71%, n = 7) compared to controls (0%, n = 14) (P = 0.01; Fisher's Exact Test). Partial sequence analysis of a total of 16 ABV isolates we have now recovered from these and an additional set of cases reveals at least 5 distinct ABV genetic subgroups.

Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can directly affect host gene pools by stable colonization. DNA viruses can be genetically complex and have evolved many unique viral genes.

Herbage dry matter digestibility both pre- and post-grazing was similar (P > 0.05) for the two systems, whereas herbage crude protein concentrations were generally significantly lower for the EXT than the INT system. There was no difference (P > 0.05) between the Systems in cow live weight, body condition score or their changes or in calf live weight gain from birth to weaning. Post-weaning, live weight gain, slaughter weight, carcass weight, kill-out proportion, estimated carcass gain, carcass conformation score or carcass fat score did not differ (P > 0.05) between the systems for heifer, steer or bull progeny. It can be concluded that similar animal performance levels can be expected in an extensive grassland-based suckler calf-to-beef system compatible with the EU, Rural Environmental Protection Scheme as that attained in a more intensive System comprising of both a moderately high SR (~ 1.25 higher) and fertiliser N application (~ 2.1 higher).",2008-06-24,"Drennan,M.J.;McGee,M.",LivestSci,83994846,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288868/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871141308001297;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871141308001297;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2008.04.013,0luxbfzt,

Upon the cooperative activity of specific Ubiquitinating enzymes, ISG15 can be conjugated to its substrates. Increasing evidence points to a role for protein ISGylation in anti-viral and anti-tumoral defense. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified ISG15 from Old World Monkeys (OWm) as a hyper-efficient protein modifier. Western blot analysis visualized more efficient conjugation of OWmISG15 relative to HuISG15 in human (Hu), monkey and mouse (Mo) cell-lines. Moreover, the substrates of OWmISG15 identified upon Tandem Affinity Purification followed by LC-MS/MS identification largely outnumbered these of HuISG15 itself. Several Ubiquitin-Conjugating enzymes were identified as novel ISGylated substrates. Introduction of a N89D mutation in HuISG15 improved its ISGylation capacity, and additional Q31K/T33A/D133N mutations yielded a HuISG15 variant with an ISGylation efficiency comparable to OWmISG15. Homology modeling and structural superposition situate N89 in the interaction interface with the Activating enzyme. Analysis of the UbE1L residues in this interface revealed a striking homology between OWmUbE1L and HuUbE1, the Activating enzyme of Ubiquitin. In line with this observation, we found efficient activation of AgmISG15, but not HuISG15 or MoISG15, by HuUbE1, thus providing a likely explanation for OWm hyperISGylation. CONCLUSIONS: This study discloses the poor conjugation competence of HuISG15 compared to OWmISG15 and maps the critical determinants for efficient conjugation. HyperISGylation may greatly assist ISGylation studies and may enhance its function as positive regulator of Interferon-related immune responses or as anti-tumoral modulator.",2008-06-18,"Pattyn,Els;Verhee,Annick;Uyttendaele,Isabel;Piessevaux,Julie;Timmerman,Evy;Gevaert,Kris;Vandekerckhove,Joël;Peelman,Frank;Tavernier,Jan",PLoSOne,18668629,True,comm_use_subset,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002427;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18560560/,1eksm537,

We examined whether polymorphisms of interleukin (IL)-12 receptor B1 (IL-12RB1) affect the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

The genotypes of 4SNPs on IL-12 RB1 gene, +705A/G,+1158T/C, +1196G/C and +1664 C/T, were determined by PCR-RFLP. Haplotypes were estimated from the genotype data using the expectation-maximisation algorithm. RESULTS: Comparison between patients and close contacts showed that individuals with the +1664 C/T (CT and TT) genotype had a 2.09-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90–7.16) and 2.34-fold (95% CI, 1.79–13.37) increased risk of developing SARS, respectively.

This chapter presents the principal examples of immunopathogenesis caused by the viruses, accompanied by speculations about its management. The most common mechanism of lesion development in virus induced immunopathology involves T cells. Usually, it seems that when CD8(+) T cells act as the controlling cell type, lesions are acute and the outcome is decided quickly. The classic example is provided by LCM in mice. The newest candidate may turn out to be SNV infection in humans. Lesions orchestrated primarily by CD4(+) T cells can be either acute or long-lasting. Curiously, in the LCMV example, if CD8(+) T cells are removed from the scene, immunopathological responses may still occur and these involve CD4(+) T cells. Such responses are far more chronic and of lower grade than those mediated by CD8(+) T lymphocytes. One possible sequel to chronic inflammatory responses to viruses is that autoreactive inflammatory reactions are initiated and an autoimmune disease occurs.

Although the infection may be responsible for some mortality, its impact is mainly associated with the impairment of intestinal functions and lower performance of animals. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cryptosporidiosis on the intestinal functions in neonatal experimentally infected Holstein calves. Absorption tests with d-xylose and retinyl-palmitate, and the lactulose/mannitol test of intestinal permeability were simultaneously performed in 1-week intervals from challenge to full recovery. In infected animals, reduced intestinal absorptive capacity for both d-xylose and retinyl-palmitate was observed on day 7 post-infection (p.i.). At the same time, a more than 100% elevation of intestinal permeability was observed in the infected calves. All intestinal functions, except absorption of retinyl-palmitate, were significantly affected and changes were detected up to day 14 p.i. In contrast, results of all tests obtained on day 21 p.i. suggest full recovery of the infected intestine.

DESIGN: This report describes the design principles, software architecture and implementation of HealthMap and discusses key challenges and future plans. MEASUREMENTS: We describe the process by which HealthMap collects and integrates outbreak data from a variety of sources, including news media (e.g., Google News), expert-curated accounts (e.g., ProMED Mail), and validated official alerts. Through the use of text processing algorithms, the system classifies alerts by location and disease and then overlays them on an interactive geographic map. We measure the accuracy of the classification algorithms based on the level of human curation necessary to correct misclassifications, and examine geographic coverage. RESULTS: As part of the evaluation of the system, we analyzed 778 reports with HealthMap, representing 87 disease categories and 89 countries. The automated classifier performed with 84% accuracy, demonstrating significant usefulness in managing the large volume of information processed by the system.

Our results show that extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization is the earliest morphological change in response to cpBVDV infection in MDBK cells. Cells with extensive vacuolization showed no co-existing chromatin condensation, caspase activation, or loss of membrane integrity. In addition, the caspase inhibitor (zVAD-fmk), although improving cell viability of infected cells from 6.7±2.2% to 18.8±2.2%, did not prevent vacuolization.

In this study, we further assessed the immune responses and protective effect of the immunization with RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-specific T cell peptide boost, as compared to those of vaccinations with RBD-rAAV and RBD-peptides alone. Our results indicated that RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-peptide boost induced similar Th1 and neutralizing antibody responses, but stronger Th2 and CTL responses than RBD-rAAV prime/boost.

Factors contributing to increased distress in HCWs working in high-risk areas treating patients with SARS have not been fully elucidated. The goal of this study was to quantify the psychological effects of working in a high-risk unit during the SARS outbreak. Methods HCWs in a Toronto hospital who worked in high-risk areas completed a questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the SARS crisis along with the Impact of Event Scale—Revised, which screens for PTSS. The comparison group consisted of clinical units that had no contact with patients infected with SARS. Results Factors that were identified to cause distress in the 248 respondent HCWs were the following: (a) perception of risk to themselves, (b) impact of the SARS crisis on their work life, (c) depressive affect, and (d) working in a high-risk unit. In addition, HCWs who cared for only one SARS patient in comparison to those caring for multiple SARS patients experienced more PTSS. Conclusions As expected, HCWs who were working in high-risk units experienced greater distress. Contrary to expectations, HCWs who experienced greater contact with SARS patients while working in the high-risk units were less distressed.

The system provides a rapid method for screening mutant proteins for expression and targeting. It is an excellent way of quickly deciding which mutant proteins might be worth further studying using stable expression systems. Expression of foreign genes using Vaccinia virus is based on recombinant viruses constructed by insertion of complementary DNA (cDNA) into the nonessential thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Both direct and indirect methods of expression are possible. The foreign gene can be inserted into the vaccinia genome by homologous recombination using a plasmid with flanking regions of vaccinia DNA. The recombinant virus is selected, expanded, and used to infect cells, which then express high levels of the foreign protein. Recombinant vaccinia viruses are generated by subcloning the foreign gene into a plasmid transfer vector so it is flanked by DNA from the vaccinia (TK) gene, which is nonessential for growth of the virus in tissue culture.

In RNA viruses' genetic recombination is defined as any process leading to the exchange of information between viral RNAs. There are two types of recombination events: legitimate and illegitimate. While legitimate (homologous) recombination occurs between closely related sequences at corresponding positions, illegitimate (nonhomologous) recombination could happen at any position among the unrelated RNA molecules. In order to differentiate between the symmetrical and asymmetrical homologous crosses, Lai defined the former as homologous recombination and the latter as aberrant homologous recombination.

Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors(1–9), but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID ‘events’ (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease ‘hotspots’). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.",2008-02-01,"Jones,KateE.;Patel,NikkitaG.;Levy,MarcA.;Storeygard,Adam;Balk,Deborah;Gittleman,JohnL.;Daszak,Peter",Nature,5285627,True,custom_license,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5960580?pdf=render;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18288193/;https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06536,27p0hig6,

In the discovery phase of analysis, pooled sera collected at week 0 and at each week p.i. to week 12 were fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography and the protein mass fingerprints obtained in individual fractions were in the M/z range 1.5–150kDa. A total of 2302 protein clusters (peaks) were identified that varied between time-points following infection with peaks increasing or decreasing in intensity, or showing transient variation in intensity, during the 12 weeks of parasite challenge. In the validation phase, candidate biomarkers in sera of individual sheep at weeks 3 and 9 p.i. were analysed, identifying 100 protein peaks, many of which are small peptides <10kDa in size: 54% of these peaks were up-regulated in intensity at week 3 or 9 p.i. Twenty-six biomarkers were chosen for further study, ranging in size from 1832 to 89,823Da: six biomarkers were up-regulated at weeks 3 and 9 p.i., 16 biomarkers were up-regulated only at week 9 p.i. and four biomarkers were down-regulated at week 9 p.i. Two biomarkers up-regulated at week 9 were identified as transferrin (77.2kDa) and Apolipoprotein A-IV (44.3kDa), respectively. The results show that the interaction between the host and F. hepatica is complex, with changes in biomarker patterns beginning within 3 weeks of infection and either persisting to weeks 9–12 or showing transient changes during infection.

We have found that SARS-CoV enters cells via pH- and receptor-dependent endocytosis. Treatment of cells with either SARS-CoV spike protein or spike-bearing pseudoviruses resulted in the translocation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV, from the cell surface to endosomes. In addition, the spike-bearing pseudoviruses and early endosome antigen 1 were found to colocalize in endosomes. Further analyses using specific endocytic pathway inhibitors and dominant-negative Eps15 as well as caveolin-1 colocalization study suggested that virus entry was mediated by a clathrin- and caveolae-independent mechanism. Moreover, cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane, which have been shown to act as platforms for many physiological signaling pathways, were shown to be involved in virus entry. Endocytic entry of SARS-CoV may expand the cellular range of SARS-CoV infection, and our findings here contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, providing new information for anti-viral drug research.

RNA pseudoknots are also of interest because of their key role in the control of ribosomal frameshifting by viral RNAs. Their mechanical properties are directly relevant to their unfolding by ribosomes during translation. We have used optical tweezers to study the kinetics and thermodynamics of mechanical unfolding and refolding of single RNA molecules. Here we describe the unfolding of the frameshifting pseudoknot from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three constituent hairpins, and three mutants of the IBV pseudoknot. All four pseudoknots cause −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. We have measured the free energies and rates of mechanical unfolding and refolding of the four frameshifting pseudoknots. Our results show that the IBV pseudoknot requires a higher force than its corresponding hairpins to unfold. Furthermore, its rate of unfolding changes little with increasing force, in contrast with the rate of hairpin unfolding. The presence of Mg2+ significantly increases the kinetic barriers to unfolding the IBV pseudoknot, but has only a minor effect on the hairpin unfolding. The greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins, and their kinetic insensitivity to force supports the hypothesis that −1 frameshifting depends on the difficulty of unfolding the mRNA.",2008-01-11,"Green,Lisa;Kim,Chul-Hyun;Bustamante,Carlos;Tinoco,Ignacio",JournalofMolecularBiology,10658314,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18021801/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607007115;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283607007115,1fdpvswz,

Spillover of hantaviruses to humans can cause severe disease that is mediated by excessive proinflammatory responses. The mechanisms mediating hantaviral persistence in rodent reservoirs remain largely unknown. Male Norway rats were inoculated with their species-specific hantavirus, Seoul virus (SEOV), and viral RNA, cytokine, and chemokine responses were evaluated in spleen and lung tissue. More viral RNA was detectable in the lungs than spleen, with copies of SEOV peaking 15-30 days post-inoculation (p.i.) and persisting for 60 days p.i. In the lungs, the expression and production of proinflammatory mediators (i.e., IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CCL5, CCL2, CX3CL1, CXCL10, VCAM, VEGF, and NOS2) remained at or below baseline throughout SEOV infection; whereas, regulatory factors, including TGF-beta and FoxP3 were elevated. Conversely, in the spleen, proinflammatory responses were induced while regulatory responses remained unchanged during infection. To determine whether reduced proinflammatory responses mediate hantavirus persistence in the lungs, male rats were administered rIL-1beta or vehicle for 30 days during SEOV infection. SEOV persistence and shedding were not affected by IL-1beta treatment. Proinflammatory responses were elevated in rIL-1beta-treated rats, but remained within physiological levels, suggesting that supra-physiological concentrations may be necessary for viral clearance at the cost of causing disease. Elevated regulatory responses may suppress excessively high proinflammatory responses at a site of elevated SEOV replication to contribute to viral persistence and prevent proinflammatory-mediated disease in reservoir hosts.",2008-01-01,"Easterbrook,JudithD;Klein,SabraL",Journalofmedicalvirology,33358019,True,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.21213;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18461618/,0rtx3d8h,

Estimates for exposure to non-SARS coronaviruses are high, particularly for 229E and OC43; however, less information regarding seroprevalence is available for HKU1 and NL63. To measure exposure rates to these four coronavirus strains (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), we devised an immunoassay based on amino- and carboxy-terminally tagged recombinant coronavirus nucleocapsid antigens. Four human and one feline coronavirus antigen were cloned into baculoviruses expressed in insect cells and recovered proteins bound in the solid phase of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based system. We screened sera from 10 children and 196 adults and established primary cutoff points based on immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels of the predominantly seronegative children. The proportion of seropositive adults for each coronavirus was as follows: 229E, 91.3%; HKU1, 59.2%; NL63, 91.8%; and OC43, 90.8%. No evidence of a significant serological response to the feline coronavirus was observed. Significant associations of coronavirus seropositivity and antibody levels with age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and season of the blood draw were tested with chi-square and regression analyses. The group II coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1) were significantly associated with race (P<or=0.009 and P<or=0.03, respectively). Elevated OC43 IgG levels were further significantly associated with smoking status (P<or=0.03), as were high NL63 titers with socioeconomic status (P<or=0.04). The high-level immunoreactivity of each coronavirus was significantly associated with the summer season (P<or=0.01 to 0.0001). In summary, high rates of exposure to 229E, NL63, and OC43 and a moderate rate of exposure to HKU1 characterized the seroprevalence among individuals in this population.

The objective of this systematic review was to identify clinical and laboratory features that differentiate dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) from other febrile illnesses (OFI) in dengue-endemic populations. METHOD Systematic review of the literature from 1990 to 30 October 2007 including English publications comparing dengue and OFI. RESULTS Among 49 studies reviewed, 34 did not meet our criteria for inclusion. Of the 15 studies included, 10 were prospective cohort studies and five were case-control studies. Seven studies assessed all ages, four assessed children only, and four assessed adults only. Patients with dengue had significantly lower platelet, white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, and a higher frequency of petechiae than OFI patients. Higher frequencies of myalgia, rash, haemorrhagic signs, lethargy/prostration, and arthralgia/joint pain and higher haematocrits were reported in adult patients with dengue but not in children. Most multivariable models included platelet count, WBC, rash, and signs of liver damage; however, none had high statistical validity and none considered changes in clinical features over the course of illness. CONCLUSIONS Several individual clinical and laboratory variables distinguish dengue from OFI; however, some variables may be dependent on age. No published multivariable model has been validated.

This prospective hospital-based study investigated the clinical role and features of hMPV in Taiwan. Methods Respiratory specimens collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection between September 1, 2003 and April 10, 2005 were screened for metapneumovirus using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results During the study period, 930 specimens were obtained from 926 hospitalized children. After exclusion of 200 cases due to lack of clinical evidence of airway infection or diseases with known etiology, 726 were included in the analysis. Among these, 33 children had a positive result for hMPV infection. The majority of these patients were admitted during spring and early summer. Twenty-one (63.6%) were younger than 2 years of age. hMPV accounted for 13.3% of respiratory infections occurring between the ages of 18 and 24 months and was as common a respiratory pathogen as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in that age group. The 11 patients (33.3%) with underlying diseases had a similar disease course to those without underlying diseases. A co-pathogen was found in 11 patients (33.3%). Infected children between 2 and 5 years of age had significantly higher titers of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (103.88 copies/mL) than children younger than 2 years (102.26 copies/mL) (p = 0.013) and children older than 5 years (102.25 copies/mL) (p = 0.005). hMPV positive cases were significantly older than those with RSV infection (p = 0.002) and had a shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.001), fewer days of oxygen use (p = 0.001) and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.004). Conclusion Metapneumovirus circulates in children in northern Taiwan during spring and early summer. hMPV was the most common respiratory pathogen in children aged between 18 and 24 months hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection.

The most familiar formats use DNA or RNA target amplification methods for enhanced sensitivity above culture and antigen-based procedures. Although gel and plate-hybridisation methods are still utilised for analysis of amplified products, detection using “real-time” methods which do not require handling of amplified products are favoured in many laboratories. Assays based on nucleic acid amplification and detection can be designed against a broad range of respiratory viruses and have been particularly useful for detection of recently identified viruses such as human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. However, the wide range of potential pathogens which can cause similar respiratory symptomology and disease makes application of individual diagnostic assays based on detection of DNA and RNA both complex and expensive. One way to resolve this potential problem is to undertake multiplexed nucleic acid amplification reactions with analysis of amplified products by suspension microarray.

The material traditionally used as vaccines is attenuated or inactivated pathogens. This approach is sometimes limited by the fact that the material for vaccination is not efficient, not available, or generating deleterious side effects. A possible theoretical alternative is the use of recombinant proteins from the pathogens. This implies that the proteins having the capacity to vaccinate have been identified and that they can be produced in sufficient quantity at a low cost. Genetically modified organisms harboring pathogen genes can fulfil these conditions. Microorganisms, animal cells as well as transgenic plants and animals can be the source of recombinant vaccines. Each of these systems that are all getting improved has advantages and limits. Adjuvants must generally be added to the recombinant proteins to enhance their vaccinating capacity. This implies that the proteins used to vaccinate have been purified to avoid any immunization against the contaminants. The efficiency of a recombinant vaccine is poorly predictable. Multiple proteins and various modes of administration must therefore be empirically evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The structure of the recombinant proteins, the composition of the adjuvants and the mode of administration of the vaccines have a strong and not fully predictable impact on the immune response as well as the protection level against pathogens. Recombinant proteins can theoretically also be used as carriers for epitopes from other pathogens.

BCEC-1 were then cultured either without matrix or on fibronectin or collagen coated Transwell(®) polyester membrane inserts, respectively, enabling separate access to the basal or apical epithelial compartments. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of BCEC-1 revealed ultrastructural features also observed in vivo, such as apical microvilli and junctional complexes. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured regularly and revealed an increase with advancing confluence in all cultures. Cultures on coated inserts reached confluence and corresponding TEER-levels at an earlier stage. In addition, the cells were tested negative for bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) virus, but were permissive for the virus. In conclusion, the BCEC-1 cell line retained characteristics of maternal caruncular epithelial cells as observed in vivo and in primary cell cultures and thus will be a highly useful tool for future studies of pathways of invasion, fetal–maternal communication, transport and infection.",2007-09-11,"Bridger,P.S.;Menge,C.;Leiser,R.;Tinneberg,H.-R.;Pfarrer,C.D.",Placenta,23502483,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17850864/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143400407001841;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0143400407001841,0y5jaf1m,

Results ICPs' role in disaster preparedness and response is essential, even in noninfectious disease emergencies. Infection control issues in shelters, such as overcrowding, foodborne illness, lack of restroom facilities, inadequate environmental cleaning procedures and products, difficulty assessing disease outbreaks in shelters, inability to isolate potentially contagious patients, and too few hand hygiene supplies can contribute to secondary disease transmission. Other important topics on which ICPs need to be trained include surge capacity, employee health and safety, incident command system, educating responders and the public on disaster preparedness, addressing changing standards/recommendations, and partnering with public health.

Their role in human disease has not yet been determined. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop sensitive and specific assays for the detection of KIV and WUV. STUDY: Two KIV (KI-A and KI-B) and three WUV (WU-A, WU-B and WU-C) real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) assays were developed and evaluated. Clinical sensitivities and specificities were determined by testing 200 respiratory specimens and the results compared to those for previously described conventional PCR assays. Limits of detection were determined, and the analytical specificities of the assays were investigated. RESULTS: No cross-reactivity was observed between the rtPCR methods and unrelated organisms. All five rtPCR assays could reliably detect 10 copies of genomic DNA equivalents per reaction, which was more sensitive than conventional methods. Compared to the conventional PCR assays, the sensitivity of the KI-A, KI-B, WU-A, WU-B and WU-C assays was 100%, 86.7% 95.5%, 100% and 100%, respectively.

We report here the rational design of an attenuated recombinant coronavirus vaccine based on a deletion in the coding sequence of the non-structural protein 1 (nsp1). In cell culture, nsp1 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), like its SARS-coronavirus homolog, strongly reduced cellular gene expression. The effect of nsp1 on MHV replication in vitro and in vivo was analyzed using a recombinant MHV encoding a deletion in the nsp1-coding sequence. The recombinant MHV nsp1 mutant grew normally in tissue culture, but was severely attenuated in vivo. Replication and spread of the nsp1 mutant virus was restored almost to wild-type levels in type I interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient mice, indicating that nsp1 interferes efficiently with the type I IFN system. Importantly, replication of nsp1 mutant virus in professional antigen-presenting cells such as conventional dendritic cells and macrophages, and induction of type I IFN in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, was not impaired. Furthermore, even low doses of nsp1 mutant MHV elicited potent cytotoxic T cell responses and protected mice against homologous and heterologous virus challenge.

The small and medium business sector is a major provider of private sector employment in Australia, yet we have little information about the preparedness of this sector for pandemic influenza. This study aimed to investigate the association between individual perceptions and preparedness for pandemic influenza among small and medium business owners and managers. METHODS: Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 201 small and medium business owners or managers in New South Wales and Western Australia. Eligible small or medium businesses were defined as those that had less than 200 employees. Binomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of having considered the impact of, having a plan for, and needing help to prepare for pandemic influenza. RESULTS: Approximately 6 per cent of participants reported that their business had a plan for pandemic influenza, 39 per cent reported that they had not thought at all about the impact of pandemic influenza on their business, and over 60 per cent stated that they required help to prepare for a pandemic. Beliefs about the severity of pandemic influenza and the ability to respond were significant independent predictors of having a plan for pandemic influenza, and the perception of the risk of pandemic influenza was the most important predictor of both having considered the impact of, and needing help to prepare for a pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that small and medium businesses in Australia are not currently well prepared for pandemic influenza. We found that beliefs about the risk, severity, and the ability to respond effectively to the threat of pandemic influenza are important predictors of preparedness.

Virus budding in general involves the distortion of a cellular membrane away from the cytoplasm, envelopment of the viral capsid by one or more lipid bilayers that are enriched in viral membrane glycoproteins, and a fission event that separates the enveloped virion from the cellular membrane. While it was initially thought that virus budding is always driven by viral transmembrane proteins interacting with the inner structural proteins, it is now clear that the driving force may be different depending on the virus. Research over the past years has shown that viral components specifically interact with host cell lipids and proteins, thereby adopting cellular functions and pathways to facilitate virus release.

The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is highly antigenic and associated with several host-cell interactions. Our previous studies using nuclear magnetic resonance revealed the domain organization of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. RNA has been shown to bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD), although recently the C-terminal half of the protein has also been implicated in RNA binding. Here, we report that the C-terminal domain (CTD), spanning residues 248–365 (NP248-365), had stronger nucleic acid-binding activity than the NTD. To determine the molecular basis of this activity, we have also solved the crystal structure of the NP248-365 region. Residues 248–280 form a positively charged groove similar to that found in the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nucleocapsid protein. Furthermore, the positively charged surface area is larger in the SARS-CoV construct than in the IBV. Interactions between residues 248–280 and the rest of the molecule also stabilize the formation of an octamer in the asymmetric unit.

Much work over the last decade has been devoted to exploring the origins of false-positive screening hits, and ligand promiscuity has emerged as one such cause. Well-known mechanisms of promiscuity include reactive species and privileged substructures. More recently, it has been found that some nonspecific screening hits form aggregates of 30–1000 nm in diameter. It has been proposed that these aggregate particles are responsible for the promiscuous behavior of many false positives and that aggregate-forming compounds may be widespread among screening hits.

The cytoplasmic portion of the S glycoprotein contains four cysteine-rich amino acid clusters. Individual cysteine clusters were altered via cysteine-to-alanine amino acid replacement and the modified S glycoproteins were tested for their transport to cell-surfaces and ability to cause cell fusion in transient transfection assays. Mutagenesis of the cysteine cluster I, located immediately proximal to the predicted transmembrane, domain did not appreciably reduce cell-surface expression, although S-mediated cell fusion was reduced by more than 50% in comparison to the wild-type S. Similarly, mutagenesis of the cysteine cluster II located adjacent to cluster I reduced S-mediated cell fusion by more than 60% compared to the wild-type S, while cell-surface expression was reduced by less than 20%. Mutagenesis of cysteine clusters III and IV did not appreciably affect S cell-surface expression or S-mediated cell fusion. The wild-type S was palmitoylated as evidenced by the efficient incorporation of 3H-palmitic acid in wild-type S molecules. S glycoprotein palmitoylation was significantly reduced for mutant glycoproteins having cluster I and II cysteine changes, but was largely unaffected for cysteine cluster III and IV mutants.

Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control can be linked to a malfunctioning health system. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public-health system. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public-health problems and, among other efforts, increased public-health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system, and started a programme to rebuild local public-health facilities. These measures contributed to acceleration in efforts to control tuberculosis. By 2005, the detection of cases of tuberculosis had increased to 80% of the estimated total new cases, permitting China to achieve the 2005 global tuberculosis control targets.

Interestingly, the detection of linear decapeptidyl-SNAC as an enzyme-dependent intermediate supports the iterative mechanism in vivo, in which two pentapeptides, one bound as an ester to the active site serine of the TE domain and the second bound as a thioester to the adjacent pan-PCP, are ligated to a decapeptidyl-pan-PCP that subsequently transferred to the adjacent TE domain and cyclized.

Four rhesus macaques were given 50 mg/kg of neutralizing human monoclonal antibody KZ52 intravenously 1 d before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units of Ebola virus, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg antibody 4 d after challenge. A control animal was exposed to virus in the absence of antibody treatment. Passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody not only failed to protect macaques against challenge with Ebola virus but also had a minimal effect on the explosive viral replication following infection.

Here we deduce from a generic mathematical model how effectiveness of tracing relates to various aspects of time, such as the course of individual infectivity, the (variability in) time between infection and symptom-based detection, and delays in the tracing process. In addition, the possibility of iteratively tracing of yet asymptomatic infecteds is considered. With these insights we explain why contact tracing was and will be effective for control of smallpox and SARS, only partially effective for foot-and-mouth disease, and likely not effective for influenza. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigate contact tracing in a model of an emerging epidemic that is flexible enough to use for most infections. We consider isolation of symptomatic infecteds as the basic scenario, and express effectiveness as the proportion of contacts that need to be traced for a reproduction ratio smaller than 1. We obtain general results for special cases, which are interpreted with respect to the likely success of tracing for influenza, smallpox, SARS, and foot-and-mouth disease epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) there is no general predictive formula for the proportion to be traced as there is for the proportion to be vaccinated; (2) variability in time to detection is favourable for effective tracing; (3) tracing effectiveness need not be sensitive to the duration of the latent period and tracing delays; (4) iterative tracing primarily improves effectiveness when single-step tracing is on the brink of being effective.",2006-12-20,"Klinkenberg,Don;Fraser,Christophe;Heesterbeek,Hans",PLoSOne,,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1762362/,1n0rg5vd,

This is the thirteenth of a series of 16 reviews that have been prepared as background for advice from the WHO Advisory Committee on Health Research to WHO on how to achieve this. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the literature on applicability, transferability, and adaptation of guidelines. METHODS: We searched five databases for existing systematic reviews and relevant primary methodological research. We reviewed the titles of all citations and retrieved abstracts and full text articles if the citations appeared relevant to the topic. We checked the reference lists of articles relevant to the questions and used snowballing as a technique to obtain additional information. We used the definition ""coming from, concerning or belonging to at least two or all nations"" for the term international. Our conclusions are based on the available evidence, consideration of what WHO and other organisations are doing and logical arguments. KEY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: We did not identify systematic reviews addressing the key questions. We found individual studies and projects published in the peer reviewed literature and on the Internet. Should WHO develop international recommendations? • Resources for developing high quality recommendations are limited. Internationally developed recommendations can facilitate access to and pooling of resources, reduce unnecessary duplication, and involve international scientists. • Priority should be given to international health problems and problems that are important in low and middle-income countries, where these advantages are likely to be greatest. • Factors that influence the transferability of recommendations across different settings should be considered systematically and flagged, including modifying factors, important variation in needs, values, costs and the availability of resources. What should be done centrally and locally? • The preparation of systematic reviews and evidence profiles should be coordinated centrally, in collaboration with organizations that produce systematic reviews. Centrally developed evidence profiles should be adaptable to specific local circumstances. • Consideration should be given to models that involve central coordination with work being undertaken by centres located throughout the world. • While needs, availability of resources, costs, the presence of modifying factors and values need to be assessed locally, support for undertaking these assessments may be needed to make guidelines applicable. • WHO should provide local support for adapting and implementing recommendations by developing tools, building capacity, learning from international experience, and through international networks that support evidence-informed health policies, such as the Evidence-informed Policy Network (EVIPNet). How should recommendations be adapted? • WHO should provide detailed guidance for adaptation of international recommendations. • Local adaptation processes should be systematic and transparent, they should involve stakeholders, and they should report the key factors that influence decisions, including those flagged in international guidelines, and the reasons for any modifications that are made.",2006-12-08,"Schünemann,HolgerJ;Fretheim,Atle;Oxman,AndrewD",HealthResPolicySyst,7839635,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17156457/,0nvyf9in,

The effect of newly discovered viruses on asthma control is less well defined. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the contribution of respiratory viruses to asthma exacerbations in children with a panel of PCR assays for common and newly discovered respiratory viruses. METHODS: Respiratory specimens from children aged 2 to 17 years with asthma exacerbations (case patients, n = 65) and with well-controlled asthma (control subjects, n = 77), frequency matched by age and season of enrollment, were tested for rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and human bocavirus. RESULTS: Infection with respiratory viruses was associated with asthma exacerbations (63.1% in case patients vs 23.4% in control subjects; odds ratio, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.7- 11.6). Rhinovirus was by far the most prevalent virus (60% among case patients vs 18.2% among control subjects) and the only virus significantly associated with exacerbations (odds ratio, 6.8; 95% CI, 3.2-14.5). However, in children without clinically manifested viral respiratory tract illness, the prevalence of rhinovirus infection was similar in case patients (29.2%) versus control subjects (23.4%, P > .05). Other viruses detected included human metapneumovirus (4.6% in patients with acute asthma vs 2.6% in control subjects), enteroviruses (4.6% vs 0%), coronavirus 229E (0% vs 1.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (1.5% vs 0%).

It has also become a promising method for epitope mapping. Research on new algorithms that assist and automate phage display based epitope mapping has attracted many groups. Most of the existing tools have not been implemented as an online service until now however, making it less convenient for the community to access, utilize, and evaluate them. RESULTS: We present MIMOX, a free web tool that helps to map the native epitope of an antibody based on one or more user supplied mimotopes and the antigen structure. MIMOX was coded in Perl using modules from the Bioperl project. It has two sections. In the first section, MIMOX provides a simple interface for ClustalW to align a set of mimotopes. It also provides a simple statistical method to derive the consensus sequence and embeds JalView as a Java applet to view and manage the alignment. In the second section, MIMOX can map a single mimotope or a consensus sequence of a set of mimotopes, on to the corresponding antigen structure and search for all of the clusters of residues that could represent the native epitope. NACCESS is used to evaluate the surface accessibility of the candidate clusters; and Jmol is embedded to view them interactively in their 3D context. Initial case studies show that MIMOX can reproduce mappings from existing tools such as FINDMAP and 3DEX, as well as providing novel, rational results. CONCLUSION: A web-based tool called MIMOX has been developed for phage display based epitope mapping. As a publicly available online service in this area, it is convenient for the community to access, utilize, and evaluate, complementing other existing programs.

The results showed a saturated layer of antibody GP3 with a thickness about 6.9 nm on the surface of the silicon wafer. The specific interaction between phage M13KO7 and antibody GP3 resulted in a variation of layer thickness. The layer of phage M13KO7 bound with antibody GP3 was 17.5 nm in the concentration of 1.1×10(10) pfu/mL.

Prior to 2003, data relating to inter-facility patient transfers were not collected in a systematic manner. Then, in an emergency setting, a comprehensive database with a complex data collection process was established. For the first time in Ontario, population-based data for patient movement between healthcare facilities for a population of twelve million are available. The PTAC database stores all patient transfer data in a large database. There are few population-based patient transfer databases and the PTAC database is believed to be the largest example to house this novel dataset. A patient transfer database has also never been validated. This paper presents the validation of the PTAC database. METHODS: A random sample of 100 patient inter-facility transfer records was compared to the corresponding institutional patient records from the sending healthcare facilities. Measures of agreement, including sensitivity, were calculated for the 12 common data variables. RESULTS: Of the 100 randomly selected patient transfer records, 95 (95%) of the corresponding institutional patient records were located. Data variables in the categories patient demographics, facility identification and timing of transfer and reason and urgency of transfer had strong agreement levels. The 10 most commonly used data variables had accuracy rates that ranged from 85.3% to 100% and error rates ranging from 0 to 12.6%. These same variables had sensitivity values ranging from 0.87 to 1.0. CONCLUSION: The very high level of agreement between institutional patient records and the PTAC data for fields compared in this study supports the validity of the PTAC database. For the first time, a population-based patient transfer database has been established.

These patients are increasingly susceptible to infection with various pathogens due to the excessive release of anti-inflammatory cytokines from anti-inflammatory effector cells. Recently, CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) found in the sera of mice with pancreatitis was identified as an active molecule for SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation. Also, the inhibitory activity of glycyrrhizin (GL) on CCL2 production was reported. Therefore, the effect of GL on SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation was investigated in a murine SIRS model. Without any stimulation, splenic T cells from mice 5 days after SIRS induction produced cytokines associated with anti-inflammatory response manifestation. However, these cytokines were not produced by splenic T cells from SIRS mice previously treated with GL. In dual-chamber transwells, IL-4-producing cells were generated from normal T cells cultured with peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) from SIRS mice. However, IL-4-producing cells were not generated from normal T cells in transwell cultures performed with PMN from GL-treated SIRS mice. CCL2 was produced by PMN from SIRS mice, while this chemokine was not demonstrated in cultures of PMN from SIRS mice treated with GL. These results indicate that GL has the capacity to suppress SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation through the inhibition of CCL2 production by PMN.",2006-09-30,"Takei,Miwa;Kobayashi,Makiko;Herndon,DavidN.;Pollard,RichardB.;Suzuki,Fujio",Cytokine,26121297,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466606002766;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17113306/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466606002766,00gotrnv,

In 2002, Thailand began active, population-based surveillance for radiographically confirmed pneumonia in Sa Kaeo Province. METHODS: Full-time surveillance officers conducted active case ascertainment at every hospital, and routine audits and a community cluster survey promoted complete and accurate reporting. A case of pneumonia was defined as acute infection with signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection and evidence of new infiltrates. An independent panel of radiologists reviewed digital images of all radiographs. RESULTS: Between September 2002 and August 2003, 777 patients met the case definition. The measured minimum incidence was 177/100 000 but the estimated incidence was as high as 580/100 000 with full adjustment for incomplete chest radiography and access to health care. Seventy-two (9%) patients died and 28% were known to be HIV positive. Fifteen (2%) patients had pneumonia twice during the year. The average cost of hospitalization for an episode of pneumonia ranged from US$490.80 to $628.60. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia is a significant and costly public health problem in Thailand.

IBV is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens. It exists as dozens of serotypes/genotypes.

Tropism of IBV includes the respiratory tract tissues, proventriculus and caecal tonsils of the alimentary tract, the oviduct and the kidney. RESULTS: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain closely related to Massachusetts (Mass) serotype was isolated from broiler chickens suffering from severe renal and respiratory distresses. The isolate was serologically identified by Dot-ELISA and further characterized by RT-PCR then genotyped using S1 gene sequence analysis. Alignment of the S1 sequence of the isolate with 16 IBV strains revealed high homology to isolates related to Mass serotype. Inoculation with the strain reproduced the disease in experimental 1-day-old chickens and resulted in 20% mortality, severe renal and moderate respiratory distresses. Marked histopathological changes in both kidney and trachea were observed in experimentally infected chickens. A protection study using the H120 live attenuated vaccine showed low protection rate in spite of high S1 sequence homology (97%). Protection based criteria were: virus re-isolation attempts from trachea, tracheal and renal histopathology as well as IBV antigens detection by immunofluorescent antibody technique in kidney sections.

Although individual, identifiable patient records are essential for conditions for which there is mandated reporting, such as tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases, they are not routinely required for effective syndromic surveillance. Public concern about the routine collection of large quantities of PHI to support non-traditional public health functions may make alternative surveillance methods that do not rely on centralized identifiable PHI databases increasingly desirable. METHODS: The National Bioterrorism Syndromic Surveillance Demonstration Program (NDP) is an example of one alternative model. All PHI in this system is initially processed within the secured infrastructure of the health care provider that collects and holds the data, using uniform software distributed and supported by the NDP. Only highly aggregated count data is transferred to the datacenter for statistical processing and display. RESULTS: Detailed, patient level information is readily available to the health care provider to elucidate signals observed in the aggregated data, or for ad hoc queries. We briefly describe the benefits and disadvantages associated with this distributed processing model for routine automated syndromic surveillance. CONCLUSION: For well-defined surveillance requirements, the model can be successfully deployed with very low risk of inadvertent disclosure of PHI – a feature that may make participation in surveillance systems more feasible for organizations and more appealing to the individuals whose PHI they hold.

Both viruses cause an acute disease, with virus replicating for less than seven days before being cleared by the developing immune responses. The viruses have a broad tropism for mitotically active cells. In neonatal animals the viruses replicate in a large number of tissues, and FPV infection of the germinal epithelium of the cerebellum leads to cerebellar hypoplasia, while CPV may infect the hearts of neonatal pups, causing myocarditis. In older animals the virus replicates systemically, primarily in the primary and secondary lymphoid tissues, and also in the rapidly replicating cells of the small intestinal epithelial crypts. A transient panleukopenia or relative lymphopenia is often observed after FPV or CPV infection, respectively. Whether the reduction in cell numbers in vivo is due to virus replicating in and killing cells, or due to other indirect effects, is not known.

Understanding the role of airline travel in large-scale influenza spread is especially important given the mounting threat of an influenza pandemic. Several recent simulation studies have concluded that air travel restrictions may not have a significant impact on the course of a pandemic. Here, we assess, with empirical data, the role of airline volume on the yearly inter-regional spread of influenza in the United States. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We measured rate of inter-regional spread and timing of influenza in the United States for nine seasons, from 1996 to 2005 using weekly influenza and pneumonia mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seasonality was characterized by band-pass filtering. We found that domestic airline travel volume in November (mostly surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday) predicts the rate of influenza spread (r (2) = 0.60; p = 0.014). We also found that international airline travel influences the timing of influenza mortality (r (2) = 0.59; p = 0.016). The flight ban in the US after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent depression of the air travel market, provided a natural experiment for the evaluation of flight restrictions; the decrease in air travel was associated with a delayed and prolonged influenza season. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first empirical evidence for the role of airline travel in long-range dissemination of influenza. Our results suggest an important influence of international air travel on the timing of influenza introduction, as well as an influence of domestic air travel on the rate of inter-regional influenza spread in the US.

Furthermore, the assay was used to experimentally test our lab's collection of influenza-positive samples from the 2004–05 and 2005–06 influenza seasons and several 2005 preseason isolates to determine the rate of vaccine-derived false-positive results under differing epidemiological conditions. Analytical and clinical validations show that the assay is both sensitive and specific. Experimental results demonstrate that 51 out of 51 influenza-positive samples collected during influenza season from ill, previously-vaccinated military personnel represent real infections with circulating strains. Finally, the assay shows that four preseason influenza-positive samples were false positives resulting from vaccine shedding. The vaccine-discriminatory RT-PCR methods described here provide the first test designed to distinguish FMV strains from circulating strains. The results show that the test is effective, and demonstrate the importance of such tests in the age of live vaccines.",2006-09-08,"Freed,NikkiE.;Myers,ChristopherA.;Russell,KevinL.;Walter,ElizabethA.;Irvine,Marina;Coon,RobertG.;Metzgar,David",MolCellProbes,,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127513/,22ewkwma,

METHODS: The study was organized in three phases: an environmental scan to describe current research activity in BC; a consultation to identify needs, gaps and opportunities with those conducting research (key informants) and the end users of research results (stakeholders); and a prioritization of the research needs emerging from the consultation. RESULTS: Analysis and synthesis of the consultation data resulted in the identification of nine research themes, which were prioritized in the following order: efficacy and cost-benefit, disease patterns, emerging infectious disease, immunology and vaccines, disease-specific research, health promotion and communications, safe food and water, knowledge translation research and genomics. Six capacity-building themes were also identified: attraction and retention, education and training, collaboration and networks, funding, dissemination of findings, and public health input, surveillance, informatics and databases. INTERPRETATION: The findings were helpful in developing a multi-disciplinary, multi-level infectious disease research agenda linking researchers in universities, hospitals and public health institutions with practitioners and policy-makers in British Columbia’s public health system.

In both physiological (meals) and pathological (infections, traumas and tumors) conditions immune cells are activated responding with the release of cytokines and other immune mediators (afferent signals). In the hypothalamus (central integration), cytokines influence metabolism by acting on nucleus involved in feeding and homeostasis regulation leading to the acute phase response (efferent signals) aimed to maintain the body integrity. Peripheral administration of cytokines, inoculation of tumor and induction of infection alter, by means of cytokine action, the normal pattern of food intake affecting meal size and meal number suggesting that cytokines acted differentially on specific hypothalamic neurons. The effect of cytokines-related cancer anorexia is also exerted peripherally. Increase plasma concentrations of insulin and free tryptophan and decrease gastric emptying and d-xylose absorption. In addition, in obesity an increase in interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 occurs in mesenteric fat tissue, which together with an increase in corticosterone, is associated with hyperglycemia, dyslipidemias and insulin resistance of obesity-related metabolic syndrome. These changes in circulating nutrients and hormones are sensed by hypothalamic neurons that influence food intake and metabolism. In anorectic tumor-bearing rats, we detected upregulation of IL-1β and IL-1 receptor mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, a negative correlation between IL-1 concentration in cerebro-spinal fluid and food intake and high levels of hypothalamic serotonin, and these differences disappeared after tumor removal. Moreover, there is an interaction between serotonin and IL-1 in the development of cancer anorexia as well as an increase in hypothalamic dopamine and serotonin production. Immunohistochemical studies have shown a decrease in neuropeptide Y (NPY) and dopamine (DA) and an increase in serotonin concentration in tumor-bearing rats, in first- and second-order hypothalamic nuclei, while tumor resection reverted these changes and normalized food intake, suggesting negative regulation of NPY and DA systems by cytokines during anorexia, probably mediated by serotonin that appears to play a pivotal role in the regulation of food intake in cancer. Among the different forms of therapy, nutritional manipulation of diet in tumor-bearing state has been investigated. Supplementation of tumor bearing rats with ω-3 fatty acid vs. control diet delayed the appearance of tumor, reduced tumor-growth rate and volume, negated onset of anorexia, increased body weight, decreased cytokines production and increased expression of NPY and decreased α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in hypothalamic nuclei. These data suggest that ω-3 fatty acid suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines production and improved food intake by normalizing hypothalamic food intake-related peptides and point to the possibility of a therapeutic use of these fatty acids. The sum of these data support the concept that immune cell-derived cytokines are closely related with the regulation of metabolism and have both central and peripheral actions, inducing anorexia via hypothalamic anorectic factors, including serotonin and dopamine, and inhibiting NPY leading to a reduction in food intake and body weight, emphasizing the interconnection of the immune and neuroendocrine systems in regulating metabolism during infectious process, cachexia and obesity.",2006-07-27,"Guijarro,Ana;Laviano,Alessandro;Meguid,MichaelM.",ProgBrainRes,38896965,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16876587/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612306530225;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079612306530225,0cfafydb,

However, many of these have been deposited in GenBank without annotations, severely limiting their value to researchers. While maintaining comprehensive genomic databases for a set of virus families at the Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center and Viral Bioinformatics – Canada , we found that researchers were unnecessarily spending time annotating viral genomes that were close relatives of already annotated viruses. We have therefore designed and implemented a novel tool, Genome Annotation Transfer Utility (GATU), to transfer annotations from a previously annotated reference genome to a new target genome, thereby greatly reducing this laborious task. RESULTS: GATU transfers annotations from a reference genome to a closely related target genome, while still giving the user final control over which annotations should be included. GATU also detects open reading frames present in the target but not the reference genome and provides the user with a variety of bioinformatics tools to quickly determine if these ORFs should also be included in the annotation. After this process is complete, GATU saves the newly annotated genome as a GenBank, EMBL or XML-format file. The software is coded in Java and runs on a variety of computer platforms. Its user-friendly Graphical User Interface is specifically designed for users trained in the biological sciences. CONCLUSION: GATU greatly simplifies the initial stages of genome annotation by using a closely related genome as a reference. It is not intended to be a gene prediction tool or a ""complete"" annotation system, but we have found that it significantly reduces the time required for annotation of genes and mature peptides as well as helping to standardize gene names between related organisms by transferring reference genome annotations to the target genome.

Experimental baits (mouse carcasses) and commercial baits (FOXOFF and PROBAIT) were prepared with either liquid or freeze-dried CHV and tested in two fox trials for their capacity to induce CHV-specific antibodies following oral baiting. Freeze-drying and storage temperatures below 0 °C had a stabilizing effect to virus infectivity.

Oral baiting with CHV induced antiviral serum antibodies in all vaccinated foxes (20/20). None of the vaccinated foxes became ill or shed infectious virus into the environment although viral DNA was detected in body secretions as evaluated by PCR.

Streamline 25 column (ID=25mm) was used as a contactor and Streamline chelating adsorbent immobilized with Ni2+ ion was used as affinity adsorbent. The dynamic binding capacity of Ni2+-loaded Streamline chelating adsorbent for the NP protein in unclarified feedstock was found to be 2.94mg ml−1 adsorbent at a superficial velocity of 200cm h−1. The direct purification of NP protein from unclarified feedstock using expanded bed adsorption has resulted in a 31% adsorption and 9.6% recovery of NP protein. The purity of the NP protein recovered was about 70% and the volume of processing fluid was reduced by a factor of 10.

An immunosuppressive subset of neutrophils (PMN-II), demonstrated in the peripheral blood of thermally injured patients, has been described as an inducer of M2Mϕ. In the present studies, the inhibitory effect of glycyrrhizin (GL) on M2Mϕ generation stimulated by PMN-II was examined. M2Mϕ were generated from resident Mϕ (R-Mϕ, lower chamber) after cultivation with PMN-II (upper chamber) in a dual-chamber transwell. However, M2Mϕ were not generated from R-Mϕ when the same transwell cultures were performed in the presence of GL. M2Mϕ were not generated from R-Mϕ after cultivation with PMN-II previously treated with GL, while R-Mϕ previously treated with GL converted to M2Mϕ after they were cultured with PMN-II in transwells. Interleukin-10 and CCL2 released from PMN-II were shown to be effector molecules responsible for the generation of M2Mϕ. However, these soluble factors were not produced by PMN-II treated with GL.

METHOD: Patients ≥ 18 years old who either had not received corticosteroid or had taken corticosteroids within 14 days from symptom onset were included. Patients receiving corticosteroids beyond 15 days or other investigational treatment within 21 days from symptom onset were excluded. Of 1313 eligible patients, 1287 with major corticosteroid dosage-type combinations were analysed. RESULTS: Crude death rate was lower among 1188 steroid-treated patients compared to 99 patients in Group No Steroid (17.0% vs. 28.3%). Among four corticosteroid groups studied, mortality was lowest in the low-dose oral prednisolone (Group P) and high-dose methylprednisolone (Group MP) groups. On multivariate analysis of the corticosteroid groups, independent factors related to death were: corticosteroid group, older age, co-morbidity, worse chest X-ray score, worse respiratory status at Days 8–10 and higher admission white cell count. Again Groups P and MP had significantly lower adjusted odds ratios for death and lower bacterial and fungal culture rates. Despite worse chest X-ray scores and higher cumulative corticosteroid dosages in Group MP compared to Group P, fewer patients required rescue pulsed corticosteroid. Patients on hydrocortisone (Group HC) had the highest positive culture rates.

If not for the 1997 avian A/H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong of China, subtype H2 is the likely candidate for the next pandemic. However, unlike previous poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza due to H5 that were controlled by depopulation with or without vaccination, the presently circulating A/H5N1 genotype Z virus has since been spreading from Southern China to other parts of the world. Migratory birds and, less likely, bird trafficking are believed to be globalizing the avian influenza A/H5N1 epidemic in poultry. More than 200 human cases of avian influenza virus infection due to A/H5, A/H7, and A/H9 subtypes mainly as a result of poultry-to-human transmission have been reported with a > 50% case fatality rate for A/H5N1 infections. A mutant or reassortant virus capable of efficient human-to-human transmission could trigger another influenza pandemic. The recent isolation of this virus in extrapulmonary sites of human diseases suggests that the high fatality of this infection may be more than just the result of a cytokine storm triggered by the pulmonary disease. The emergence of resistance to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and recently oseltamivir while H5N1 vaccines are still at the developmental stage of phase I clinical trial are causes for grave concern. Moreover, the to-be pandemic strain may have little cross immunogenicity to the presently tested vaccine strain. The relative importance and usefulness of airborne, droplet, or contact precautions in infection control are still uncertain. Laboratory-acquired avian influenza H7N7 has been reported, and the laboratory strains of human influenza H2N2 could also be the cause of another pandemic.

The conservation of the N-terminal region in two apparently unrelated proteins of two different RNA virus families suggested that this helix might represent an independent module. To test this hypothesis, we constructed chimeric poliovirus (PV) genomes in which the sequence encoding the N-terminal 2C amphipathic helix was replaced by orthologous sequences from other picornaviral genomes or a similar sequence from NS5A of HCV. Effects of the mutations were assessed by measuring the accumulation of viable virus and viral RNA in HeLa cells after transfection, examining membrane morphology in cells expressing chimeric proteins and by in vitro analysis of RNA translation, protein processing and negative strand RNA synthesis in HeLa cell extracts.

The costly treatment of infected individuals with multiple highly efficient anti-HIV drugs is only affordable in industrialized countries. Thus, an efficient vaccination strategy is required to prevent the further spread of the infection. The molecular biology of coronaviruses and particular features of the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) indicate that HCoV 229E-based vaccine vectors can become a new class of highly efficient vaccines. First, the receptor of HCoV 229E, human aminopeptidase N (hAPN or CD13) is expressed mainly on human dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages indicating that targeting of HCoV 229E-based vectors to professional antigen presenting cells can be achieved by receptor-mediated transduction. Second, HCoV 229E structural genes can be replaced by multiple transcriptional units encoding various antigens. These virus-like particles (VLPs) containing HCoV 229E-based vector RNA have the ability to transduce human DCs and to mediate heterologous gene expression in these cells. Finally, coronavirus infections are associated with mainly respiratory and enteric diseases, and natural transmission of coronaviruses occurs via mucosal surfaces. In humans, HCoV 229E causes common cold by infecting the upper respiratory tract. HCoV 229E infections are mainly encountered in children and re-infection occurs frequently in adults. It is thus most likely that pre-existing immunity against HCoV 229E will not significantly impact on the vaccination efficiency if HCoV 229E-based vectors are used in humans.",2006-01-01,"Eriksson,KlaraK.;Makia,Divine;Maier,Reinhard;Ludewig,Burkhard;Thiel,Volker",ClinDevImmunol,13264901,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17162377/,1c4m2fym,

Therefore, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) proteases are attractive targets for the development of antiviral drugs to reduce viral replication and pathogenicity. The structure and activity of the coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) has already been elucidated, and the design of inhibitors to 3CLpro as therapeutics has been proposed. The chapter discusses SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors that include covalent inhibitors, noncovalent inhibitors, and inhibitors from screening. SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) is considered an equally viable target to 3CLpro for drug design because both are essential for viral replication. However, PLpro has likely not been pursued because of the paucity of structural information. Several compounds have been identified that have shown inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV. However, no information regarding their mechanism of action or the corresponding target is known. Glycyrrhizin showed inhibitory activity for SARS-CoV replication with EC50 = 300 mg/L after virus absorption in Vero cells.

The intestinal flora of pigs contains several hundred microbial species, mostly strict anaerobes. A great amount of these bacteria reside in the large intestine that in adult pigs consists of mainly Gram-positive bacteria such as cocci, lactobacilli, eubacteria, and clostridia. The composition of the intestinal microflora is a result of the interaction between the microorganisms that colonize the gut and the intestinal physiology of the pigs. While a part of this microflora is constantly present in the gut (resident flora), some microorganisms have a short residence and dynamically change the composition of the microflora. The stability and diversity of this flora has a tremendous role in maintaining the health status of the pigs, especially during the suckling and post-weaning period. The digestive tract of the newborn piglet is specialized on a diet comprising milk. Therefore, a high lactase activity is present in the small intestine, at least for as long as milk comprises the dominant feed source. While several methods, including molecular-based techniques, are available to detect and identify unculturable bacterial flora of the gut, there is a need for more advanced techniques to measure the functional status of the normal flora in response to dietary feed and environmental stress.",2005-12-31,"Katouli,M.;Wallgren,P.",BiologyofGrowingAnimals,82029870,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877182309700359;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877182309700359,0ujg8srm,

Of course, the public health authorities in Japan have started to prepare control measures for such events. We report here our attempts, using a mathematical model, to estimate outbreak size and to examine the most effective measures; comparing ring vaccination (contact tracing, isolation, and vaccination among contacts) and mass vaccination of the susceptible population in the area. The basic framework of the mathematical model follows a model used in previous research. The initial susceptible population is assumed to be 30 million persons. Concerning the important parameters, such as the number of initial-exposure cases, R 0 (infectious power, or natural history) and, the starting day of intervention after the initial exposure, we checked the robustness of our conclusions by sensitivity analysis. We found that mass vaccination is preferable to ring vaccination when the values for the initial-exposure cases and R 0 are high and when the start of intervention by public health authorities is delayed. In the base-case situation, the mass vaccination strategy needs almost 30 million vaccine doses. On the other hand, though ring vaccination needs fewer doses, it needs fewer than 50â€‰000 doses in the worst-case scenario, that with larger first exposure, higher R 0, or later start of public health authority intervention. This mathematical model can measure the prevalence of an infectious disease and can evaluate control measures for it before an outbreak. Especially, it is useful for the planning of the outbreaks of emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or for bioterrorism attacks involving such diseases as smallpox. In further research, we will have to take into account the population people vaccinated of for smallpox, who account for about 70% of the total population in Japan.",2005-12-31,"Ohkusa,Yasushi;Taniguchi,Kiyosu;Okubo,Ichiro",JournalofInfectionandChemotherapy,42022600,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X05710072;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15856374/;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X05710072,1kpooq3j,

Methods A join-count spatial statistic study was conducted and the given hypothetical processes of the spread of SARS in Beijing were tested using various definitions of ‘joins’. Results The spatial statistics showed that of the six diffusion processes, the highest negative autocorrelation occurred in the doctor-number model (M-5) and the lowest negative autocorrelation was found in the population-amount model (M-3). The results also showed that in the whole 29-day research period, about hour or more days experienced a significant degree of contagion. Conclusions Spatial analysis is helpful in understanding the spatial diffusion process of an epidemic. The geographical relationships were important during the early phase of the SARS epidemic in Beijing. The statistic based on the number of doctors was significant and more informative than that of the number of hospitals.

The protocol was rapidly and effectively instituted by teamwork training using high-fidelity simulation. METHODS: Phase 1 was a curriculum design of a SARS-specific cardiac arrest protocol in three steps: planning the new protocol, repeated simulations of this protocol in a classroom, and a subsequent simulation of a cardiac arrest on a hospital ward. Phase 2 was the training of 275 healthcare workers (HCWs) using the new protocol. Training involved a seminar, practice in wearing the mandatory personal protection system (PPS), and cardiac arrest simulations with subsequent debriefing. RESULTS: Simulation provided insights that had not been considered in earlier phases of development. For example, a single person can don a PPS worn for the SARS patient in 1 1/2 minutes. However, when multiple members of a cardiac arrest team were dressing simultaneously, the time to don the PPS increased to between 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 minutes. Errors in infection control as well as in medical management of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) were corrected. CONCLUSION: During the SARS crisis, real-time use of a high-fidelity simulator allowed the training of 275 HCWs in 2 weeks, with debriefing and error management. HCWs were required to manage the SARS cardiac arrest wearing unfamiliar equipment and following a modified ACLS protocol.

No pulmonary function abnormalities were detected in 59 patients (63%). Mean scores were significantly higher (ie, worse) than the population norms in the activity (p < 0.001), impacts (p < 0.001), and total (p < 0.001) domains of the SGRQ. Conclusions One year after recovery from SARS, persistent pulmonary function impairment was found in about one third of patients. The health status of SARS survivors was also significantly worse compared with the healthy population.

The advantages of DNA vaccines, such as the opportunity to combine the genetic information of various antigen epitopes and stimulatory cytokines, the enhanced stability and ease of production make this class of vaccines attractive and suitable for mucosal application. In contrast to the area of intranasal vaccination, only a few recent studies have focused on pulmonary immunization and the involvement of the pulmonary immune system in eliciting protective immune responses against inhaled pathogens. This review focuses on DNA vaccine delivery to the lung as a promising approach to prevent pulmonary-associated diseases caused by inhaled pathogens.

Methods Six different hand hygiene products were added separately to heparinised blood samples in varying amounts as contaminant. The contaminated samples were analysed by three different blood gas and electrolyte analysers for assessing interference on measured whole blood sodium and potassium concentrations. Results There were significant analytical interferences caused by hand hygiene product contamination that varied depending on the combination of disinfectant and analyser. Small amounts of Microshield Antibacterial Hand Gel contamination caused large increases in measured sodium concentration. Such effect was much greater compared with the other five products tested, and started to occur at much lower levels of contamination. There was a trend towards lower sodium results in blood samples contaminated with Hexol Antiseptic Lotion (Hexol), the hand hygiene product that we used initially. Apart from AiE Hand Sanitizer, all the other hand disinfectants, especially Hexol, significantly elevated the measured potassium concentration, particularly when a direct ion-selective electrode method was used for measurement.

The precise mechanisms of ICP0-mediated transactivation are under intensive study. Here, we demonstrate that ICP0 can strongly activate AP-1 responsive genes specifically. This activation is inhibited by c-Jun (S73A), c-Jun (S63/73A), TAK1 (K63W), but not by p38 (AF), ERK1 (K71R), ERK2 (K52R) and TRAF6 (C85A/H87A). We further investigate the relevancy of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK pathways using their respective inhibitors PD98059, SP600125 and SB202190. Only SP600125 significantly attenuates the AP-1 responsive gene activation by ICP0. Consistent with these, the JNK is remarkably activated in response to ICP0, and this JNK activation is shown to be significantly attenuated by TAK1 (K63W). It turns out that ICP0 interacts specifically with TAK1 and stimulates its kinase activity. These findings reveal a new molecular mechanism ICP0 explores to regulate gene expression.",2005-08-01,"Diao,Lirong;Zhang,Bianhong;Xuan,Chenghao;Sun,Shaogang;Yang,Kai;Tang,Yujie;Qiao,Wentao;Chen,Qimin;Geng,Yunqi;Wang,Chen",ExperimentalCellResearch,36363497,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15896775/;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014482705001928;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482705001928,14bu5b1a,

Modelling is possible because epidemics involve relatively simple processes occurring within large populations of individuals. Modelling aims to explain and predict trends in disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality. Models give important insight into the development of epidemics. Following disease establishment, epidemic growth is approximately exponential. The rate of growth in this phase is primarily determined by the basic reproduction number (R0), the number of secondary cases per primary case when the population is susceptible. R0 also determines the ease with which control policies can control epidemics. Once a significant proportion of the population has been infected, not all contacts of an infected individual will be with susceptible people. Infection can now continue only because new births replenish the susceptible population. Eventually, an endemic equilibrium is reached whereby every infected person infects one other individual on average. Heterogeneity in host susceptibility, infectiousness, human contact patterns and the genetic composition of pathogen populations introduces substantial additional complexity into the models required to model real diseases realistically. The contribution concludes with a brief review of the recent application of mathematical models to emerging human and animal epidemics, notably the spread of HIV in Africa, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease epidemic in the UK and its relationship to bovine spongiform encephalitis in cattle, the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in UK livestock, bioterrorism threats such as smallpox, and the SARS epidemics in 2003.",2005-03-01,"Ferguson,NeilM",Medicine,199591670,True,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1383/medc.33.3.1.61124;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288561/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303906001769;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357303906001769,0njpw3zz,

Summary Introduction In November 2002 an epidemic of atypical pneumonia appeared in the Chinese region of Guandong. It was subsequently given the name “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome” (SARS) following the occurrence of further outbreaks in Hanoi and Hong Kong in February 2003. Five cases related to the same patient source have been reported in France. Case report We report the case of a patient of 52 years who had direct contact with a probable case of SARS. On admission the patient presented with pyrexia associated with lymphopenia and liver cell necrosis but no respiratory symptoms. The chest x-ray was normal. The thoracic CT scan showed a sub pleural ground glass appearance. Early (36 hours) PCR studies of naso-pharyngeal washings were negative for the coronavirus associated with SARS. The diagnosis was confirmed serologically. Conclusions This observation demonstrates the existence of incomplete clinical presentations of SARS. The infectivity of this asymptomatic form is unknown.

The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of these measurements. METHODS: Parents and then nurses measured the temperature of 60 children with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use (home thermometer). The reference standard was a temperature measured by a nurse with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals (hospital thermometer). A difference of ≥ 0.5 °C was considered clinically significant. A fever was defined as a temperature ≥ 38.5 °C. RESULTS: The mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent and the nurse with the home thermometer was 0.44 ± 0.61 °C, and 33% of the readings differed by ≥ 0.5 °C. The mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent with the home thermometer and the nurse with the hospital thermometer was 0.51 ± 0.63 °C, and 72 % of the readings differed by ≥ 0.5 °C. Using the home thermometer, parents detected fever with a sensitivity of 76% (95% CI 50–93%), a specificity of 95% (95% CI 84–99%), a positive predictive value of 87% (95% CI 60–98%), and a negative predictive value of 91% (95% CI 79–98 %). In comparing the readings the nurse obtained from the two different tympanic thermometers, the mean absolute difference was 0.24 ± 0.22 °C. Nurses detected fever with a sensitivity of 94% (95 % CI 71–100 %), a specificity of 88% (95% CI 75–96 %), a positive predictive value of 76% (95% CI 53–92%), and a negative predictive value of 97% (95%CI 87–100 %) using the home thermometer. The intraclass correlation coefficient for the three sets of readings was 0.80, and the consistency of readings was not affected by the body temperature. CONCLUSIONS: The readings done by parents with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use differed a clinically significant amount from the reference standard (readings done by nurses with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals) the majority of the time, and parents failed to detect fever about one-quarter of the time.

RV cytopathic effect has been shown to be due to caspase-dependent apoptosis in a number of susceptible cell lines, and it has been suggested that this apoptotic induction could be a causal factor in the development of such defects. Often the outcome of apoptotic stimuli is dependent on apoptotic, proliferative and survival signaling mechanisms in the cell. Therefore we investigated the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt survival signaling and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK proliferative signaling during RV-induced apoptosis in RK13 cells. Increasing levels of phosphorylated ERK, Akt and GSK3β were detected from 24–96 hours post-infection, concomitant with RV-induced apoptotic signals. Inhibition of PI3K-Akt signaling reduced cell viability, and increased the speed and magnitude of RV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that this pathway contributes to cell survival during RV infection. In contrast, inhibition of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway impaired RV replication and growth and reduced RV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the normal cellular growth is required for efficient virus production.",2005-01-04,"Cooray,Samantha;Jin,Li;Best,JenniferM",VirolJ,16882102,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15631631/,1i36lsj2,

Objectives: This paper describes a PCR-hybridization-immunoenzymatic assay (PCR Adenovirus consensus®) used to detect Ad and identify Ad species in respiratory specimens. Results: On seven representative serotypes Ad 12, Ad 3, Ad 7, Ad 11, Ad 1, Ad 8, Ad 4, the mean genome equivalents per ml and the mean 50% infectious doses per ml were 106.3and 104, respectively. Using 362 nasal aspirates from children, Ad were detected by immunofluorescence (IF) and culture in 97 cases (27%), by the PCR-Ad hexon method in 107 cases (29.5%) and by the PCR Adenovirus Consensus® method in 113 cases (31.2%); 13 samples were found positive by both PCR and negative by the IF and culture methods; five samples were only positive according to the PCR Adenovirus Consensus® method. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value and predictive negative value of the PCR Adenovirus Consensus® method were 97.9%, 93.2%, 84%, 99.1%, respectively. The method identified the species (sp) from 91 positive amplicons: 1 Ad sp A, 44 Ad sp B, 42 Ad sp C, 3 Ad sp E, and 1 Ad sp F; 85 isolates were identified by IF or the neutralisation in culture, and 86 by a PCR-RE digestion method. The PCR Adenovirus Consensus® detected six positive samples that were negative according to the IF and culture methods, and it identified the precise species of nine IF-positive and culture-negative nasal aspirates. Conclusion: The PCR Adenovirus Consensus® technique is more efficient than the classical IF or culture techniques for the detection of Ad in respiratory samples.

Our recent study indicated that SARS-CoV infection induces activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and the p38 MAPK inhibitor partially inhibited its cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells. The results of the present study indicated that before cell death, Akt, which is an inhibitor of apoptosis, was also activated in response to viral replication. Phosphorylation of a serine residue on Akt was detected at least 8 h postinfection (hpi), which declined after 18 hpi. Thus, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is activated in virus-infected Vero E6 cells. However, a threonine residue was not phosphorylated. A downstream target of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), was slightly phosphorylated, indicating that the level of activation of Akt was very low.

The recent emergence of this new pathogen, the careful tracing of its transmission patterns, and the ability to propagate in culture allows the exploration of the mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV in human populations. METHODS: We sequenced complete SARS-CoV genomes taken from primary human tissues (SIN3408, SIN3725V, SIN3765V), cultured isolates (SIN848, SIN846, SIN842, SIN845, SIN847, SIN849, SIN850, SIN852, SIN3408L), and five consecutive Vero cell passages (SIN2774_P1, SIN2774_P2, SIN2774_P3, SIN2774_P4, SIN2774_P5) arising from SIN2774 isolate. These represented individual patient samples, serial in vitro passages in cell culture, and paired human and cell culture isolates. Employing a refined mutation filtering scheme and constant mutation rate model, the mutation rates were estimated and the possible date of emergence was calculated. Phylogenetic analysis was used to uncover molecular relationships between the isolates. RESULTS: Close examination of whole genome sequence of 54 SARS-CoV isolates identified before 14(th )October 2003, including 22 from patients in Singapore, revealed the mutations engendered during human-to-Vero and Vero-to-human transmission as well as in multiple Vero cell passages in order to refine our analysis of human-to-human transmission. Though co-infection by different quasipecies in individual tissue samples is observed, the in vitro mutation rate of the SARS-CoV in Vero cell passage is negligible. The in vivo mutation rate, however, is consistent with estimates of other RNA viruses at approximately 5.7 × 10(-6 )nucleotide substitutions per site per day (0.17 mutations per genome per day), or two mutations per human passage (adjusted R-square = 0.4014). Using the immediate Hotel M contact isolates as roots, we observed that the SARS epidemic has generated four major genetic groups that are geographically associated: two Singapore isolates, one Taiwan isolate, and one North China isolate which appears most closely related to the putative SARS-CoV isolated from a palm civet. Non-synonymous mutations are centered in non-essential ORFs especially in structural and antigenic genes such as the S and M proteins, but these mutations did not distinguish the geographical groupings. However, no non-synonymous mutations were found in the 3CLpro and the polymerase genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the SARS-CoV is well adapted to growth in culture and did not appear to undergo specific selection in human populations. We further assessed that the putative origin of the SARS epidemic was in late October 2002 which is consistent with a recent estimate using cases from China. The greater sequence divergence in the structural and antigenic proteins and consistent deletions in the 3' – most portion of the viral genome suggest that certain selection pressures are interacting with the functional nature of these validated and putative ORFs.",2004-09-06,"Vega,VinsensiusB;Ruan,Yijun;Liu,Jianjun;Lee,WahHeng;Wei,ChiaLin;Se-Thoe,SuYun;Tang,KinFai;Zhang,Tao;Kolatkar,PrasannaR;Ooi,EngEong;Ling,AiEe;Stanton,LawrenceW;Long,PhilipM;Liu,EdisonT",BMCInfectDis,17918049,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15347429/,0gmtnkbh,

In this study, we analyzed the region of the APN gene that encodes a stretch of amino acid residues, essential for its HCoV-229E receptor function (amino acids 260–353). Methods: Full-length APN exon 3, intron 3 and exon 4, was PCR-amplified and sequenced in DNA samples from 100 unrelated Caucasian Belgian healthy volunteers. Results: We identified seven polymorphisms, including four intron 3 and three exon 4 variations. Apart from the already known C956T exon 4 mutation, the six other polymorphisms have not yet been described. The most prevalent APN variations in this population (C956T leading to an alanine to valine substitution, G978T, G987A and intron3-C389T) always occurred together at an allele frequency of 8.5%. Haploid DNA sequencing demonstrated the presence of these four variations on the same allele. Three polymorphisms in intron 3, intron3-G395C, intron3-C86T, and intron3-C429T, were identified with an allele frequency of 3.5%, 1% and 0.5% respectively. Five haplotypes were identified in the population of 100 individuals.

Mild central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, such as headache and drowsiness, can result from systemically elevated cytokine levels and therefore are common in many virus infections, even in the absence of the infection of the CNS. CNS infection is quite unusual and is initiated either as a result of the viremia or, more rarely, as a result of neural spread. The poliovirus infects the anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, causing poliomyelitis, the disease for which the virus is named. DNA vaccination is a relatively new entrant in the vaccine sweepstakes, but is viewed with optimism, for a number of reasons. DNA vaccines encoding the nucleoprotein from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can confer protection against the normally lethal intracranial challenge. In rabies, in a mouse model, immunization with plasmids encoding the rabies glycoprotein conferred complete protection against subsequent viral challenge. Several virus-induced CNS diseases may be explained by their triggering of autoimmunity.

Previously, we found that MHV-JHM neurovirulence was marked by diminished expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) mRNA and a reduced presence of CD8 T cells in the CNS concomitant with heightened macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 transcript levels and greater macrophage infiltration relative to MHV-A59 infection. Here, the ability of the S and non-spike genes to regulate these immune responses was evaluated using chimeric viruses. Chimeric viruses WTR13 and S4R22 were made on MHV-A59 variant backgrounds and, respectively, contained the S gene of MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM. Unexpectedly, genes other than S appeared to modulate events critical to viral replication and survival. Unlike unresolving MHV-JHM infections, the clearance of WTR13 and S4R22 infections coincided with strong IFN-γ transcription and an increase in the number of CD8 T cells infiltrating into the CNS. However, despite the absence of detectable viral titers, approximately 40% of S4R22-infected mice succumbed within 3 weeks, indicating that the enhanced mortality following S4R22 infection was not associated with high viral titers. Instead, similar to the MHV-JHM infection, reduced survival following S4R22 infection was observed in the presence of elevated MIP-1α and MIP-1β mRNA accumulation and enhanced macrophage numbers within infected brains. These observations suggest that the S protein of MHV-JHM influences neurovirulence through the induction of MIP-1α- and MIP-1β-driven macrophage immunopathology.",2004-01-05,"Rempel,JuliaD.;Murray,ShannonJ.;Meisner,Jeffrey;Buchmeier,MichaelJ.",Virology,26010451,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14972534/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203006585;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203006585,0vby04et,

However, the time sequence of symptom development was rarely discussed. The objective of this study is to chronologically document the time sequence of symptom development in probable SARS cases and compare that of the febrile non-SARS cases, thus providing valuable information for early recognition of the disease. METHODS: This prospective, descriptive, cohort study was conducted in an academic university hospital in Taipei, Taiwan, from March 14 through May 12, 2003. Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a temperature of at least 38.0°C (≥100.3°F) and exposure history were evaluated with a structured protocol. Detailed time sequences of individual symptoms were recorded, and chest radiography and laboratory test results were obtained. Probable SARS cases were determined by the Center of Disease Control Taiwan. Children younger than 15 years and suspected SARS patients with negative polymerase chain reaction results were excluded from final analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-nine SARS and 220 non-SARS cases were analyzed. The major clinical symptoms of SARS patients on ED presentation were myalgia, loose stool or diarrhea, nonproductive cough or dyspnea, headache, and chills. Upper airway symptoms, including rhinorrhea and sore throat, were rarely seen in the SARS patients but were common in the non-SARS group. Characteristic symptom sequence, consisting of initial fever accompanied by diarrhea and myalgia and then progressive respiratory symptoms, was identified in 55 SARS patients (69.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 0.80) but only 7 (3.2%; 95% CI 0.008 to 0.05) non-SARS patients. Chest radiographic abnormality may precede lower respiratory tract symptoms in some SARS patients.

SARS case fatality has varied across geographical areas, which might be partially explained by air pollution level. METHODS: Publicly accessible data on SARS morbidity and mortality were utilized in the data analysis. Air pollution was evaluated by air pollution index (API) derived from the concentrations of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ground-level ozone. Ecologic analysis was conducted to explore the association and correlation between air pollution and SARS case fatality via model fitting. Partially ecologic studies were performed to assess the effects of long-term and short-term exposures on the risk of dying from SARS. RESULTS: Ecologic analysis conducted among 5 regions with 100 or more SARS cases showed that case fatality rate increased with the increment of API (case fatality = - 0.063 + 0.001 * API). Partially ecologic study based on short-term exposure demonstrated that SARS patients from regions with moderate APIs had an 84% increased risk of dying from SARS compared to those from regions with low APIs (RR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.41–2.40). Similarly, SARS patients from regions with high APIs were twice as likely to die from SARS compared to those from regions with low APIs. (RR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.31–3.65). Partially ecologic analysis based on long-term exposure to ambient air pollution showed the similar association. CONCLUSION: Our studies demonstrated a positive association between air pollution and SARS case fatality in Chinese population by utilizing publicly accessible data on SARS statistics and air pollution indices.

Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three SARS-CoV proteins: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5′ fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3′ fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5′ tree could be rejected for the 3′ region, and the optimal 3′ tree could be rejected for the 5′ region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1–3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals. The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3′ RDRP fragment of SARS-CoV suggests an additional host-species shift. Demonstration of recombination in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.",2003-09-30,"Rest,JoshuaS;Mindell,DavidP","Infection,GeneticsandEvolution",22486927,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134803000935;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134803000935;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14522185/,0t9ok1jb,

The genomic sequence relationship of SARS-CoV with 30 different single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses of various families was studied using two non-standard approaches. Both approaches began with the vectorial profiling of the tetra-nucleotide usage pattern V for each virus. In approach one, a distance measure of a vector V, based on correlation coefficient was devised to construct a relationship tree by the neighbor-joining algorithm. In approach two, a multivariate factor analysis was performed to derive the embedded tetra-nucleotide usage patterns. These patterns were subsequently used to classify the selected viruses. RESULTS: Both approaches yielded relationship outcomes that are consistent with the known virus classification. They also indicated that the genome of RNA viruses from the same family conform to a specific pattern of word usage. Based on the correlation of the overall tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGV) and the Feline CoronaVirus (FCoV) are closest to SARS-CoV. Surprisingly also, the RNA viruses that do not go through a DNA stage displayed a remarkable discrimination against the CpG and UpA di-nucleotide (z = -77.31, -52.48 respectively) and selection for UpG and CpA (z = 65.79,49.99 respectively). Potential factors influencing these biases are discussed. CONCLUSION: The study of genomic word usage is a powerful method to classify RNA viruses. The congruence of the relationship outcomes with the known classification indicates that there exist phylogenetic signals in the tetra-nucleotide usage patterns, that is most prominent in the replicase open reading frames.",2003-09-20,"Yap,YeeLeng;Zhang,XueWu;Danchin,Antoine",BMCBioinformatics,2407633,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14499005/,1wswi7us,

It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. RESULTS: In this report, we show first that the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. CONCLUSION: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to be inconsistent, suggesting that they are incomplete or do not reflect an appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.",2003-09-10,"Ng,TuenWai;Turinici,Gabriel;Danchin,Antoine",BMCInfectDis,8140402,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12964944/,0qaoam29,

The recombinant virus, which expresses spike with the three substitutions, was nonfusogenic at neutral pH.

By expressing candidate signals in Escherichia coli, and in wheatgerm extracts depleted of endogenous tRNAs and supplemented with prokaryotic or eukaryotic tRNA populations, we show that when decoding AAG in the ribosomal A-site, E.coli tRNA(Lys) promotes a highly unusual single-tRNA slippage event in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. This event does not appear to require slippage of the adjacent P-site tRNA, although its identity is influential. Conversely, asparaginyl-tRNA promoted a dual slippage event in either system. Thus, the tRNAs themselves are the main determinants in the selection of single- or dual-tRNA slippage mechanisms.

Four of the 16 (25%) coccidia-positive, diarrhoeic piglets, and four of the 37 (10.8%) coccidia-positive non-diarrhoeic piglets shed I. suis oocysts, an observation which seems to weaken the present contention that I. suis is the primary causative agent of neonatal porcine occidiosis. The highest mean number of oocysts per gram faeces (23 550) was recorded from the diarrhoeic farm piglets on conrete, and the lowest of 6,100 from the gestating farm sows. Mean opg data revealed very little significant quantitative variation between the corresponding age groups of the free-ranging village pigs and the commercially-farmed ones.

Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls. The treatment with ACTH induced high, but physiological, concentrations of cortisol in plasma. Simultaneously, the number of lymphocytes per milliliter blood decreased while the neutrophil number increased. The elevated concentrations of cortisol also coincided with reduced proliferation and interleukin-2 production by blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin in vitro, while the responses to pokeweed mitogen were less affected. The suppression of mitogen responses was more pronounced in cultures of whole blood than in cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibody production, induced by M. hyopneumoniae in cultures of purified PBMC was also inhibited by ACTH treatment. Both the rate of increase and the magnitude of the antibody production induced by the primary immunization were reduced. In contrast, no effects of ACTH treatment were recorded for the response to the second immunization or on the serum levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-α (IFN-α) at exposure in vitro to fixed pseudorabies virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-α-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC.

Five PRV strains were used to infect AM including strains that are known to be highly virulent for pigs, i.e. strain 4892 and strain S-62 as well as strains that are regarded as mild or nonvirulent, i.e. BUK and Bartha. The multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.005 to 0.05 TCID(50)/cell. The target cells in the cytotoxicity assays were either chicken red blood cells, PRV-infected vero cells, or human myeloblastoma cells (K562 cell line). For the producton of IFN, AM cultures were treated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) diluted in tissue culture media at a concentration of 5 μg/10(6) cells. Culture supernatants were collected at various times poststimulation and tested for antiviral activity using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus replication inhibition test. Swine AM were able to lyse chicken red blood cells in an antibody-independent way but not in an antibody-dependent way, whereas lysis of PRV-infected vero cells was accomplished both ways. The cytotoxicity against chicken red blood cells was reduced in the PRV-infected AM as compared to noninfected cells, particularly in AM infected with virulent PRV strains. Specific (51)Cr release values for AM infected with S-62 and 4892 strains were 14 and 19, while the noninfected AM had values of 36. Similarly, in the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay against PRV-infected vero cells there was no activity of AM against K562 cells. The production of IFN was readily stimulated with Poly I:C. The optimal time for supernatant collection was between 12 and 16h poststimulation. The antiviral activity was abrogated by treatment of the supernatant with antiserum against human leukocyte IFN; it was therefore considered to be due to interferon-alpha (IFNα) released from the macrophages. The antiviral activity present in supernatants of PRV-infected AM was reduced compared to noninfected AM. The difference between AM cultures infected with virulent strains of PRV and noninfected AM cultures was statistically significant at P ⩽ 0.025.

At the farm level, data were stratified by season, with two six-month seasons (winter and summer) per year. The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above-median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Larger farms had significantly greater odds of experiencing mortality than smaller farms in both winter and summer. Farms which had policies of attending calvings and ensuring that calves received their first colostrum had significantly lower odds of experiencing winter mortality than farms which did not have these policies. Farms which housed calves in hutches had significantly lower odds, and those which housed calves in group pens had significantly higher odds, of experiencing summer mortality, than farms which used individual indoor calf-pens. A policy of teat removal between four weeks of age and weaning was associated with increased odds of summer mortality. At the individual calf level, calving ease, sire, navel treatment, assistance at first colostrum feeding, administration of vitamins A, D and E and anti-scour vaccines to the pregnant dam, and place of calving, were all associated with significantly altered odds of dying.

Since MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules, while FLU-specific and mumps-specific CTL have large HLA class I-restricted components, reduced MV-specific CTL may reflect a broader reduction in HLA class II-restricted CTL in patients with MS. To examine this question we studied the generation of CTL specific for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). HSV-specific CTL, like MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules. We found that patients with MS had reduced generation of CTL to both MV and HSV. Most, but not all patients who had reduced generation of CTL to one virus also had a similar impairment with respect to the second virus. Some patients, however, had a reduction in the generation of CTL only to MV or to HSV. These findings extend our earlier observations regarding reduced MV-specific CTL in patients with MS to a second HLA class II-restricted virus, HSV.

Digestive disorders connected with BHV1 are in general only observed in calves and mainly in Belgium. Virus strains causing abortion or encephalitis are only present in a few countries. The same is true for BHV1 induced mastitis. Dermatitis and lesions in the interdigital space seem to be a rare event. BHV1 infections are frequently complicated by bacterial secondary infections, but there is evidence that BHV1 infections can occur simultaneously with bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) and/or parainfluenza-3 (PI 3) virus. The biggest problem associated with BHV1 infection is the ability of the agent to become latent following a primary infection. The genome of the virus probably remains during the life of the animal in the ganglia of the region where the primary infection occurred. No vaccination can overcome this latent stage. By prophylactic vaccination it is possible to prevent an outbreak of clinical disease but it is impossible to prevent infection followed by the establishment of latency.

The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of HCoV-related NVRI in neonates and children hospitalized in a PNICU and the prevalence of viral respiratory tract infections in staff. All neonates (age≤28 days) and children (age>28 days) hospitalized between November 1997 and April 1998 were included. Nasal samples were obtained by cytological brush at admission and weekly thereafter. Nasal samples were taken monthly from staff. Virological studies were performed, using indirect immunofluorescence, for HCoV strains 229E and OC43, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus types A and B, paramyxoviruses types 1, 2 and 3 and adenovirus. A total of 120 patients were enrolled (64 neonates and 56 children). Twenty-two samples from 20 patients were positive (incidence 16.7%). In neonates, seven positive samples, all for HCoV, were detected (incidence 11%). Risk factors for NVRI in neonates were: duration of hospitalization, antibiotic treatment and duration of parenteral nutrition (P<0.01). Monthly prevalence of viral infections in staff was between 0% and 10.5%, mainly with HCoV. In children, 15 samples were positive in 13 children at admission (seven RSV, five influenza and three adenovirus) but no NVRI were observed. In spite of a high rate of community-acquired infection in hospitalized children, the incidence of NVRI with common respiratory viruses appears low in neonates, HCoV being the most important pathogen of NRVI in neonates during this study period.

Estudios realizados con infecciones experimentales hablan que al menos en ciertas condiciones esta infección puede extenderse al tracto respiratorio inferior, al mismo tiempo que el virus puede actuar sobre el epitelio respiratorio. Experimentos in vitro con células del sistema inmune y del tracto respiratorio inferior sugieren mecanismos de actuación directamente ligados a la producción de citocinas proinflamatorias. Existen evidencias tanto in vivo como in vitro que muestran que los rinovirus pueden estimular a las células epiteliales bronquiales para que produzcan citocinas y quimocinas proinflamatorias. Al mismo tiempo pueden estimular el sistema nervioso colinérgico y no colinérgico, incrementan la producción de ICAM-1, y pueden dar lugar a respuestas de los linfocitos T inespecíficas o a replicación de los mismos en directa relación con la infección vírica.Por otra parte se ha comprobado una mayor producción de cistenil leucotrienos en las secreciones de los pacientes afectos de broncospasmo La infección experimental con rinovirus conduce a un aumento de la sintomatología clínica y de la hiperreactividad bronquial esta última asociada a un aumento de eosinófilos y de proteína catiónica en esputo.

Studies carried out with experimental infections report that at least in certain conditions, this infection may spread to the lower respiratory tract as the virus acts on the respiratory epithelium. In vitro experiments with cells from the immune system and lower respiratory tract suggest that the mechanisms of action are directly linked to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both in vivo and in vitro evidence shows that rhinoviruses may stimulate bronchial epithelial cells to produce cytokines and pro-inflammatory chemokines. They may also stimulate the cholinergic and non-cholinergic nervous system, increasing the production of ICAM-1 and may give rise to a T-lymphocyte non-specific response or to T-lymphocyte replication in direct relation with viral infection. In addition, greater production of cysteinyl leukotrienes has been observed in the secretions of patients with bronchospasm Experimental infection with Rhinovirus increases clinical symptomatology and bronchial hyperreactivity. The latter is associated with increased eosinophils and cationic proteins in sputum The above findings suggest that multiple cellular pathways are involved in the induction of exacerbations of asthma induced by the virus. In addition, the possible stimulating role of exposure to allergens in sensitized patients would also increase allergic inflammation Because of the limited therapeutic efficacy of steroids in reducing exacerbations, new treatment strategies based on greater insight into the physiopathology of the role of viruses in asthma are needed",2001-12-31,"Boquete,M.;Carballada,F.",AllergologiaetImmunopathologia,71711724,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301054601790337;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301054601790337,09whopck,

Joo et al., 1996, J. Virol. 70, 5769–5776). However, the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts are poor templates for positive-strand DI RNA synthesis. The present study demonstrated that DI RNA accumulation from the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts in MHV-infected cells was enhanced by the coexpression of complementary RNA transcripts that correspond to the 5′ region of positive-strand DI RNA. The positive-strand RNA transcripts corresponding to the 5′ end-most 0.7–2.0 kb DI RNA had a similar enhancement effect. The coexpressed positive-strand RNA transcripts lacking the leader sequence or those containing only the leader sequence failed to demonstrate this enhancement effect, demonstrating that the presence of the leader sequence in the coexpressed positive-strand RNA transcripts was necessary, but not sufficient, for the enhancement of DI RNA accumulation from the coexpressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts. Negative-strand DI RNA transcripts that were coexpressed with the partial-length positive-strand RNA transcripts were no more stable than those expressed alone, suggesting that a higher stability of the expressed negative-strand RNA transcripts was an unlikely reason for the higher DI RNA accumulation in cells coexpressing two complementary DI RNA transcripts. Sequence analyses unexpectedly demonstrated that the leader sequence of the majority of accumulated DI RNAs switched to helper virus derived leader sequence, suggesting that enhancement of DI RNA accumulation was mediated by the efficient utilization of helper virus derived leader sequence for DI RNA synthesis. Furthermore, our data suggested that this leader switching, a type of homologous RNA–RNA recombination, occurred during positive-strand DI RNA synthesis and that MHV positive-strand RNA synthesis mechanism may have a preference toward recognizing double-stranded RNA structures over single-stranded negative-strand RNA to produce positive-strand DI RNAs.",2001-09-01,"Banerjee,Sangeeta;Repass,JohnF.;Makino,Shinji",Virology,11270098,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11531407/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682201910475;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682201910475,0yp4c4ks,

This was studied in a bovine model for infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), analysing the induction of the two most dominant bovine acute phase proteins haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA). Strong and reproducible acute phase responses were detected for both proteins, peaking at around 7–8 days after inoculation of BRSV, while no response was seen in mock-inoculated control animals. The serum concentrations reached for SAA and haptoglobin during the BRSV-induced acute phase response were generally the same or higher than previously reported for bacterial infections in calves.

Pigs were intranasally inoculated with the European PRRSV strain, Lelystad virus ter Huurne, and were vaccinated intramuscularly with PRV 2 weeks later (LV-PRV group). Control pigs were vaccinated with PRV only (PRV group). Eight weeks after PRV vaccination, pigs from both groups were challenged intranasally with wild-type PRV. We measured the lymphoproliferative, and the cytolytic responses to PRV of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), isolated from blood samples. In addition, serum samples were examined for antibodies against PRV and LV. One week after PRV vaccination, PBMC proliferated abundantly to PRV in both groups. However, in the LV-PRV group the lymphoproliferative response declined after 1 week, whereas, in the PRV group, the lymphoproliferative response was high for 3 weeks and declined thereafter (P<0.05). After challenge, the lymphoproliferative response was 1 week earlier and was consistently and significantly higher in the PRV group than in the LV-PRV group. The PRV-specific killing was higher at 3 weeks after PRV vaccination and 5 weeks after PRV challenge 19±3 and 24±6%, respectively, in the PRV group, compared to 7±4 and 6±9%, respectively, in the LV-PRV group (P<0.05). However, later after vaccination and challenge the cytolytic response was identical in both groups. The antibody titre against PRV developed equally in both groups. After challenge, no PRV virus was isolated from both groups.

Demyelination occurs in infected white matter areas in the absence of inflammation. The mechanism of demyelination is not apparent because there is no ultrastructural evidence of viral replication in the oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells. However, brain tissue culture studies have shown that oligodendrocytes support transcription of all CDV genes and later on degenerate, although no viral proteins can be found in these cells. It remains to be shown how such a restricted infection leads to demyelination. Concomitant with immunologic recovery during the further course of the disease, inflammation occurs in the demyelinating lesions with progression of the lesions in some animals. A series of experiments in vitro suggested that chronic demyelination is due to a bystander mechanism associated with the virus-induced immune response in which antibody dependent cell-mediated reactions play an important role. The progressive, or even relapsing, course of the disease is associated with viral persistence in the nervous system.

In this review we highlight some of the many factors that are likely to influence the degree of pollution by their effect on both the vertical and horizontal transport of microorganisms through soil. Soil pH, temperature, the presence of plants, microbial surface properties, type of waste, soil type and soil water content and flow may all affect the rate and extent of vertical transport, with the latter two generally considered to be the most important.

Virus-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that recognize infected cells and contribute to viral clearance and tissue injury during HCV infection could be involved in the induction of AIH. To explore whether the antiviral cellular immunity may turn against self-antigens, we characterized the primary CTL response against an HLA-A*0201–restricted HCV-derived epitope, i.e., HCV core 178–187, which shows sequence homology with human CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 8–17. To determine the relevance of these homologies for the pathogenesis of HCV-associated AIH, we used synthetic peptides to induce primary CTL responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy blood donors and patients with chronic HCV infection. We found that the naive CTL repertoire of both groups contains cross-reactive CTLs inducible by the HCV peptide recognizing both CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 peptides as well as endogenously processed CYP2A6 protein. Importantly, we failed to induce CTLs with the CYP-derived peptides that showed a lower capacity to form stable complexes with the HLA-A2 molecule.

Viral infection can be identified in 24 % to 31.9 % of children, and in 13.3 % of adults. The three most frequent viruses are rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV), detected in 8.8 %, 6.4 % and 6 % of cases, respectively. Due to its amplifying properties, the use of PCR increases the frequency of viral detection, and appears particularly appropriate in asthma where the viral load can be reduced. In a study of bronchiolitis, RSV, PIV3, AdV and RV were identified in 39.3 %, 4.3 %, 1.4 % and 3.9 % of cases, respectively, by IF or culture, and in 62.4 %, 8.3 %, 10.8 % and 12.6 % of cases, respectively, by PCR. Two recent epidemiological surveys used molecular diagnosis in asthma attacks. In a series of 61 adults, 27 (44 %) infections were identified: 16 RV, 4 CV OC43, 3 PIV, 1 RSV, 1 VI, 1 Chlamydia psitacci. In children, viral infection was detected in 226 cases (77 %) : 84 RV, 38 CV, 21 IV, 21 PIV, 12 RSV. We have performed a short retrospective survey for 1997, using molecular biology, on 39 nasal aspirates from children consulting for asthma or wheezing bronchitis. Testing for respiratory viruses by conventional techniques identified 8 (20.5 %) viral infections: 3 RV, 3 RSV, 1 IBV and 1 VPI2. After nucleic acid extraction, PCR-hybridization techniques were applied to these samples to detect RSV, AdV, RV, CV 229E, CV OC43, CP and MP sequences. Twenty six aspirates (54 %) were positive only on molecular biology techniques: 11 RSV, 12 RV, 2 enterovirus, 1 CV OC43. Overall 34 (82 %) viral infections were detected in these children, and a mixed RSV-RV infection was identified in 6 cases.

In infected cells MHV produces a 3′ coterminal nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs. Only the genomic RNA, however, is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein and incorporated in infectious MHV virions. It is believed that an RNA packaging signal (Ps), present only in the genomic RNA, is responsible for this selectivity. Earlier studies mapped this signal to a 69-nt stem–loop structure positioned in the 3′ end of ORF1b. The selective encapsidation mechanism probably initiates by specific interaction of the packaging signal with the nucleocapsid protein. In this study we demonstrate thein vitrointeraction of the MHV-A59 nucleocapsid protein with the packaging signal of MHV using gel retardation and UV cross-linking assays. This interaction was observed not only with the nucleocapsid protein from infected cells but also with that from purified virions and from cells expressing a recombinant nucleocapsid protein. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by competition experiments with nonlabeled Ps containing RNAs, tRNA, and total cytoplasmic RNA. The results indicated that no virus specific modification of the N-protein or the presence of other viral proteins are required for thisin vitrointeraction.

Mice were infected with an antibody escape variant which produces a nonlethal encephalomyelitis and compared to a clonal virus population which produces a fulminant fatal encephalomyelitis. Infection with both viruses induced the accumulation of mRNAs associated with Th1- and Th2-type cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10. Peak mRNA accumulations were coincident with the clearance of virus and there was no obvious differences between lethally and nonlethally infected mice. TNF-α mRNA was induced more rapidly in lethally infected mice compared to mice undergoing a nonfatal encephalomyelitis. Rapid transient increases in the mRNAs encoding IL-12, iNOS, IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 occurred following infection. Nonlethal infections were associated with increased IL-12, IL-1β, and earlier expression of IL-6, while lethal infections were associated with increased iNOS and IL-1α mRNA.

However, neither the accumulation nor kinetics of induction provide evidence to distinguish lethal infections from nonlethal infections leading to a persistent infection.

The closterovirus group combines several positive-strand RNA viruses with very flexuous filamentous particles, of which beet yellows virus (BYV) is the type virus. Closteroviruses are distinct from other RNA viruses of plants in some important phenomenological aspects. They have genomes of up to 20 kilobases (kb), a value comparable only to those of the animal coronaviruses and toroviruses, which have the largest RNA genomes of all positive-strand RNA viruses. The existence of such genomes having a coding capacity several times that of an average RNA virus genome raises questions as to the trend whereby the long genomes have evolved and the possible novel functions they have acquired. The dramatic increase in the closterovirus genome coding capacity may be linked to the distinct ecological niche they occupy. Thus, closteroviruses are the only elongated plant viruses known so far to cause phloem-limited infections in plants and to persist in their insect vectors for many hours, in contrast to only minutes.",1996-12-31,"Agranovsky,A.A.",AdvancesinVirusResearch,39037273,True,custom_license,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8895832/;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352708607356;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352708607356,0kcujnfa,

The emergence of a “new” pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown. This review tries to summarize the facts that are known about a wide variety of “new” viruses of mammals, such as the simian, human and feline lentiviruses, the feline coronaviruses, the feline parvoviruses, the carnivore morbilliviruses, the influenza A viruses, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned in plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and the translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were raised in rabbits. Antisera that immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7 were obtained. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORFs 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated membrane protein of 25 kDa (E). The N protein is encoded by ORF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The E protein in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to endo-β-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase H.

This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER compartment(s), but the exact compartment(s) where the retrieval occurs remains unresolved. With an affinity-purified antibody against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the mammalian KDEL receptor, we have investigated its subcellular localization using immunogold labeling on thawed cryosections of different tissues, such as mouse spermatids and rat pancreas, as well as HeLa, Vero, NRK, and mouse L cells. We show that rab1 is an excellent marker of the intermediate compartment, and we use this marker, as well as budding profiles of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells infected with this virus, to identify this compartment. Our results demonstrate that the KDEL receptor is concentrated in the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack. Lower but significant labeling was detected in the rough ER. In general, only small amounts of the receptor were detected on the trans side of the Golgi stack, including the trans- Golgi network (TGN) of normal cells and tissues. However, some stress conditions, such as infection with vaccinia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus, as well as 20 degrees C or 43 degrees C treatment, resulted in a significant shift of the distribution towards the trans- TGN side of the Golgi stack. This shift could be quantified in HeLa cells stably expressing a TGN marker. No significant labeling was detected in structures distal to the TGN under all conditions tested. After GTP gamma S treatment of permeabilized cells, the receptor was detected in the beta-COP-containing buds/vesicles that accumulate after this treatment, suggesting that these vesicles may transport the receptor between compartments. We propose that retrieval of KDEL- containing proteins occurs at multiple post-ER compartments up to the TGN along the exocytotic pathway, and that within this pathway, the amounts of the receptor in different compartments varies according to physiological conditions.",1994-12-02,,JCellBiol,18199705,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7798312/,13eqppt9,

In addition, the subcellular distribution of the connexins was determined. In vitro-synthesis in the presence of microsomes resulted in the signal recognition particle-dependent membrane insertion of the connexins. The membrane insertion of all connexins was accompanied by an efficient proteolytic processing that was dependent on the microsome concentration. Endogenous unprocessed connexins were detectable in the microsomes used, indicating that the pancreatic microsomes serve as a competent recipient in vivo for unprocessed full length connexins. Although oriented with their amino terminus in the cytoplasm, the analysis of the cleavage reaction indicated that an unprecedented processing by signal peptidase resulted in the removal of an amino-terminal portion of the connexins. Variable amounts of similar connexin cleavage products were also identified in the ER membranes of connexin overexpressing cells. The amount generated correlated with the level of protein expression.

Prior work demonstrated that the 118-amino acid cytoplasmic domain is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention and that mutant or overexpressed DPAP A no longer retained in the Golgi was delivered directly to the vacuolar membrane (Roberts, C. J., S. F. Nothwehr, and T. H. Stevens. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 119:69-83). Replacement of the DPAP A transmembrane domain with a synthetic hydrophobic sequence did not affect either Golgi retention of DPAP A or vacuolar delivery of the retention-defective form of DPAP A. These results indicate that the DPAP A transmembrane domain is not involved in either Golgi retention or targeting of this membrane protein. A detailed mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A indicated that the most important elements for retention were within the eight residue stretch 85-92. A 10-amino acid region from DPAP A (81- 90) was sufficient for Golgi retention of alkaline phosphatase, a type II vacuolar membrane protein. Detailed mutational analysis within this 10-amino acid sufficient region demonstrated that a Phe-X-Phe-X-Asp motif was absolutely required for efficient retention. The efficiency of Golgi retention via the DPAP A signal could be diminished by overexpression of wild type but not retention-defective versions of Kex2p, another late Golgi membrane protein, suggesting that multiple Golgi membrane proteins may be retained by a common machinery. These results imply a role for a cytoplasmic signal involving aromatic residues in retention of late Golgi membrane proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",1993-06-02,,JCellBiol,,True,noncomm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2119699/,0pz80zbg,

In this study we have defined a novel post-RER, pre-Golgi compartment where unassembled subunits of rubella virus (RV) E1 glycoprotein accumulate. When RV E1 is expressed in CHO cells in the absence of E2 glycoprotein, transport of E1 to the Golgi complex is arrested. The compartment in which E1 accumulates consists of a tubular network of smooth membranes which is in continuity with the RER but has distinctive properties from either the RER, Golgi, or previously characterized intermediate compartments. It lacks RER and Golgi membrane proteins and is not disrupted by agents which disrupt either the RER (thapsigargin, ionomycin) or Golgi (nocodazole and brefeldin A). However, luminal ER proteins bearing the KDEL signal have access to this compartment. Kinetically the site of E1 arrest lies distal to or at the site where palmitylation occurs and proximal to the low temperature 15 degrees C block. Taken together the findings suggest that the site of E1 arrest corresponds to, or is located close to the exit site from the ER. This compartment could be identified morphologically because it is highly amplified in cells overexpressing unassembled E1 subunits, but it may have its counterpart among the transitional elements of non-transfected cells.

Immunofluorescence assays performed both on insect and mammalian cells revealed that ORF4 was a membrane-associated protein, a finding consistent with the prediction of a membrane-spanning segment in ORF4 sequence. Two epitopes were localized within the last 21 C-terminal residues of the sequence through peptide scanning and analysis of the reactivity of a truncated ORF4 recombinant protein. Since the relevant MAbs were found to induce a cell surface fluorescence, these data suggest that ORF4 may be an integral membrane protein having a Cexo-Nendo orientation. Anti-ORF4 MAbs were also used to show that ORF4 polypeptide may be detected in TGEV virion preparations, with an estimated number of 20 molecules incorporated per particle.

The signal is comprised of two elements, a heptanucleotide “slip-site” and a downstream tertiary RNA structure in the form of an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the pseudoknot and its contribution to the frameshift process by analysing the frameshifting properties of a series of pseudoknot mutants. Our results show that the pseudoknot structure closely resembles that which can be predicted from current building rules, although base-pair formation at the region where the two pseudoknot stems are thought to stack co-axially is not a pre-requisite for efficient frameshifting. The stems, however, must be in close proximity to generate a functional structure. In general, the removal of a single base-pair contact in either stem is sufficient to reduce or abolish frameshifting. No primary sequence determinants in the stems or loops appear to be involved in the frameshift process; as long as the overall structure is maintained, frameshifting is highly efficient. Thus, small insertions into the pseudoknot loops and a deletion in loop 2 that reduced its length to the predicted functional minimum did not influence frameshifting. However, a large insertion (467 nucleotides) into loop 2 abolished frameshifting. A simple stem-loop structure with a base-paired stem of the same length and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot could not functionally replace the pseudoknot, suggesting that some particular conformational feature of the pseudoknot determines its ability to promote frameshifting.",1991-08-20,"Brierley,Ian;Rolley,NicolaJ.;Jenner,AlisonJ.;Inglis,StephenC.",JournalofMolecularBiology,6164396,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283691903619;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1880803/;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0022283691903619,1m9s5bus,

The disposition of the E protein in the membrane was studied by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes and by subsequent proteinase K digestion. Only small portions of either end of the polypeptide were found to be exposed on opposite sides of the vesicle membranes. Experiments with a hybrid E protein (EM) containing the C-terminal tail of a coronavirus M protein, to which an anti-peptide serum was available, showed that this C-terminus was present at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is another similarity to the coronavirus M protein. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that the EM protein, expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus, accumulated in intracellular membranes, predominantly those of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Specifically the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) generally causes an acute encephalitis when inoculated is into 2-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In contrast, JHM generally produces a chronic demyelinating disease with resulting posterior paralysis when inoculated is into 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, while JHM readily produces a productive infection in a mouse fibroblast cell line (L-2), it does not form syncytia or replicate well in a tissue cell line of glial origin (G26-24). We have isolated and characterized three MHV-JHM viral variants from the central nervous system of two Wistar Furth rats with a MHV-JHM-induced demyelinating disease. The pattern of viral-specific mRNA for all three of these variants differed from what was observed for the wild-type parental MHV-JHM that had been passaged only in tissue culture. One of these variants, ATIIf cord virus, which induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2- or 10-day-old intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats, had a deletion in the coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein mRNA. In addition, this variant formed massive syncytia and replicated well in G26-24 cells. We have not detected this deletion in the other two JHM variants, ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus. ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus primarily produced an acute encephalitis when reinoculated into 2-or 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats.

The 3'-region of this leader sequence contains several repeats of a pentanucleotide (UCUAA), whose number varies among different MHV strains. It has been demonstrated that this UCUAA repeat plays crucial roles in the discontinuous transcription of MHV mRNAs. In the present study, we demonstrate that the number of UCUAA repeats in the leader sequence of MHV genome rapidly decreases during serial passages of viruses on susceptible cells. The downward evolution of the number of UCUAA repeats was not due to a higher growth rate of the viruses with fewer repeats, but seemed to be due to homologous interference between viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeat. The ease with which these variant viruses arose suggests the high frequency of the occurrence of this deletion during RNA replication. This finding is in agreement with the proposed discontinuous and nonprocessive mode of coronavirus RNA synthesis. Analysis of the intracellular subgenomic mRNA species of viruses with different numbers of UCUAA repeats and of MHV recombinant viruses suggests that the number of this pentanucleotide repeat at the 3′-end of the leader sequence may regulate the synthesis of certain mRNA species, in agreement with the leader-primed transcription mechanism.",1989-03-31,"Makino,Shinji;Lai,MichaelM.C.",Virology,6462783,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289900603;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2538033/;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682289900603,1esr4qcz,

The apparent size and shapes of coronaviruses can vary considerably. Coronavirus particles are spherical, although negatively stained air-dried particles are often pleomorphic. The morphology of coronavirus surface projections can vary considerably between different strains. The conventional structure on negative staining consists of tear-drop-shaped projections, although cone-shaped projections are also observed. In all these cases, the projections have the same length of about 20 nm. Other coronaviruses have short as well as 20-nm projections. Projections with blebs on thin stalks have been reported for other coronaviruses.",1987-12-31,"Macnaughton,MalcolmR.;Davies,HeatherA.",PerspectivesinMedicalVirology,82415742,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168706908700946;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287596/;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168706908700946;https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(08)70094-6,0dac26xk,

This “mini-exon” sequence is derived from the 5′ end of a 137 nucleotide RNA (medRNA). The remainder of each mRNA is derived from a protein-coding exon that is not linked to the mini-exon. We propose that medRNA is spliced in trans to de-novo-initiated transcripts of protein-coding genes. This trans splicing model predicts that the downstream portion of medRNA will be part of a branched structure and then be released as a free product (minRNA). We demonstrate that significant levels of minRNA exist in trypanosome RNA. Furthermore, minRNA can be released from high molecular weight RNA by a HeLa cell S100 “debranching” extract.

HA was observed at all temperatures with chicken, mouse, rat, and hamster erythrocytes but not with erthyrocytes of human (O), cattle, horses, sheep, guinea pigs, geese, ducks, pigeons and 1-day-old chicks. Chickens showed an individual variation in agglutinability of their erythrocytes, requiring selection of birds to obtain erythrocytes for HA. HA reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. Some factors involved in HA and HA inhibition (HI) were investigated and standard HA and HI tests were worked out.",1977-06-30,"Sato,K.;Inaba,Y.;Kurogi,H.;Takahashi,E.;satoda,K.;Omori,T.;Matumoto,M.",VeterinaryMicrobiology,84853303,True,custom_license,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378113577900359;https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0378113577900359,1o94q0yr,

VP50 is the only structural protein which is completely unaffected by protease treatment of intact virions. This species is the most highly labeled by polar amino acids such as glutamic acid and arginine and it is probably associated with the viral nucleocapsid. GP90, GP180, and GP23 are membrane-associated proteins. However, after protease treatment of virions, only 20% of the GP23 molecule is digested, whereas all of the GP90 and GP180 are removed. GP90 and GP180 appear to comprise most of the prominent layer of characteristic projections on the external surface of the viral envelope. The major portion of GP23 is presumed to lie within the lipid envelope, protected from protease digestion. GP23 and the protease resistant portion, p∗18, exhibit anomalous behavior on SDS-PAGE. After heating to 100° in SDS the electrophoretic mobility of these polypeptides is altered and several new forms of lower mobility are produced. β-Mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol exaggerate the effects of heating.",1977-04-30,"Sturman,LawrenceS.",Virology,37198319,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682277904883;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/855186/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682277904883,1v9fcmom,

Purity of the virus was confirmed by electrophoretic, ultracentrifugal, and electron microscopic procedures. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis tests revealed one precipitin line with normal mouse brain, three with purified virus, and four with crude virus when tested against anti-pure virus or anti-crude virus animal serums. The association of a host cell antigen with the virion was confirmed by standard HI and CF tests. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of solubilized purified virus revealed a minimum of six polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 191,000 (No. 1), 104,000 (No. 2), 60,000 (No. 3), 47,000 (No. 4), 30,000 (No. 5), and 15,000 daltons (No. 6). A seventh band was occasionally found in the 165,000-dalton region of the gels. Four polypeptides contained carbohydrate and one contained lipid. Polypeptide No. 5 comprised 26% of the total viral protein and glycopolypeptide No. 3 comprised 23%. Three other components accounted for most of the remaining protein: polypeptide No. 4 (16%), glycopolypeptide No. 6 (14%), and glycolipopolypeptide No. 1 (13%). Glycopolypeptide No. 2 was 8% of the total protein. Bromelin digestion of the viral projections (spikes) removed glycopolypeptides No. 2 and No. 6. Association of the remaining polypeptides with structural components of the virion is only tentatively postulated. The buoyant density in potassium tartrate of the bromelin-treated virus was 1.15 g/cm3 and of the intact OC 43 virion was 1.18 g/cm3. By analytical ultracentrifugation the corrected sedimentation coefficient (s 0 20w) of the OC 43 virion was determined to be 390 ± 16 S, and the apparent molecular weight (MW a ) was calculated to be 112 ± 5 × 106 daltons.",1972-05-31,"Hierholzer,J.C.;Palmer,E.L.;Whitfield,S.G.;Kaye,H.S.;Dowdle,W.R.",Virology,6799653,True,custom_license,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682272900621;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4623502/;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682272900621,0b1qaecu,
